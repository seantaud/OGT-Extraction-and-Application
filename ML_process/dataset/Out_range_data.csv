1929,1488,Clostridium acetobutylicum,C. acetobutylicum,what is the optimal growth temperature of Clostridium acetobutylicum?,"The peak located in the region from 1000 to 1100 cm−1 in the spectra of the pretreated materials indicates the C–O stretching vibration, methoxy groups and β-1,4 bonds, additionally this could be related to the increase in cellulose recovery [55]. The peaks at 1240 cm−1, 1375 cm−1 and the 1500-1600 cm−1 region correspond to signals from lignin, thus in the alkaline pretreatment the signals were less intense. Hydrogen production from pretreated corncob through consolidated processing Fig. 4 shows the effects of the four factors evaluated on the production of BioH2 through CBP using H2SO4 pretreated corncob. The values shown in the green bars in each graph represent the mean of the BioH2 production at the three levels for each factor, and the dashed line represents the mean of all the values obtained in the nine experiments (272 mL). The temperature effect over BioH2 production showed that the optimal condition was at 35 °C with 309 mL (Fig. 4a). It has been reported that both the microbes present in the Bovine ruminal fluid (BRF) and the pure strain of C. acetobutylicum grow optimally at a temperature below to 40 °C [55,56]. Therefore, it is not unusual that 35 °C is the optimal temperature to produce BioH2 from pretreated corncob using a synergy between BRF and Clac.",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.046,below to 40 °C,-40.0

Protein Preparation and Assays—The recombinant cold-adapted NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (Phlig) was overexpressed at 18 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3) as previously described (19), except that the growth was performed in TB medium (12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4 ml/liter glycerol, 12.54 g/liter K2HPO4, 2.32 g/liter KH2PO4, pH 7) containing 50 μg ml– 1 kanamycin, and that induction was performed when OD600 reached ∼4. The cold His-tagged enzyme was then purified by Ni2 +-Hitrap Chelating followed by thrombin digestion, second Ni2 +-Hitrap Chelating to separate untagged protein from the undigested ligase, and Mono Q HR 5/5, as described previously (19). Plasmid encoding E. coli DNA ligase was a generous gift from V. Sriskanda and S. Shuman (20). The pET-EcoLIG plasmid (20) was digested with NdeI and BamHI and the insert cloned into pET23a plasmid, leading to the overexpression of an untagged protein. The recombinant Eclig was overexpressed at 37 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3) as previously described (20), except that the growth was performed in TB-ampicillin medium containing 100 μg ml– 1 ampicillin, and that induction was performed when OD600 reached ∼3.
