The reason for the presence of multiple bands may be the number of 16S rRNA operons in the genome of the species. It is known that members of the genus Methanosarcina have three operons (http://rrndb.cme.msu.edu/rrndb/servlet/controller), which may form different secondary structures during SSCP analysis, resulting in multiple bands formed by only one species. In contrast, sequencing indicated that more sequences than single bands contributed to the SSCP profiles, which is a well-known phenomenon also observed in the study of Sekiguchi et al. [35]. However, two bands of the SSCP profile contained single stranded DNA from relatives of the M. thermophilus species, a thermophilic member of the family Methanomicrobium, which could not be detected by cloning analyses in the previous study [39]. With a growth optimum of 55°C [15] this species finds optimal conditions in compost heaps. The optimum methane production in the different materials took place in the same temperature span.

Nevertheless, the (hyper)thermophilic members of the order Thermotogales harbor tetraester, tetraether, and mixed ether/ester membrane-spanning lipids mostly composed of core lipids derived from diabolic acids, C30, C32, and C34 dicarboxylic acids with two adjacent mid-chain methyl substituents. Lipid analysis of Thermotoga maritima across growth phases revealed a decrease of the relative abundance of fatty acids together with an increase of diabolic acids with independence of growth temperature. We also identified isomers of C30 and C32 diabolic acids, i.e., dicarboxylic acids with only one methyl group at C-15. Their distribution suggests they are products of the condensation reaction but are preferably produced when the length of the acyl chains is not optimal. Compared with growth at the optimal temperature of 80°C, an increase of glycerol ether-derived lipids was observed at 55°C. Our analysis only detected diabolic acid-containing intact polar lipids with phosphoglycerol (PG) head groups. Considering these findings, we hypothesize a biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of membrane-spanning lipids based on PG polar lipid formation, suggesting that the protein catalyzing this process is a membrane protein. We also identified, by genomic and protein domain analyses, a gene coding for a putative plasmalogen synthase homologue in T. maritima that is also present in other bacteria producing sn-1-alkyl ether lipids but not plasmalogens, suggesting it is involved in the conversion of the ester-to-ether bond in the diabolic acids bound in membrane-spanning lipids.", "id": 105, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermotoga maritima?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2336+Thermotoga maritima"}

To elucidate the microalgal response to stressful supra-optimal temperature, we studied the physiology of Picochlorum sp.

Cell growth, cell composition and mRNA expression patterns were regularly analyzed for 120 h after increasing the temperature. The supra-optimal temperature caused cell cycle arrest for 8 h, with concomitant changes in metabolic activity. Accumulation of fatty acids was observed during this period to store unspent energy which was otherwise used for growth. In addition, the microalgae changed their pigment and fatty acid composition. For example, palmitic acid (C16:0) content in the polar fatty acid fraction increased by 30%, hypothetically to reduce membrane fluidity to counteract the effect of increased temperature. After the relief of cell cycle arrest, the metabolic activity of Picochlorum sp. (BPE23) reduced significantly over time. A strong response in gene expression was observed directly after the increase in temperature, which was dampened in the remainder of the experiment. mRNA expression levels associated with pathways associated with genes acting in photosynthesis, carbon fixation, ribosome, citrate cycle, and biosynthesis of metabolites and amino acids were downregulated, whereas the proteasome, autophagy and endocytosis were upregulated.", "id": 314, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Picochlorum sp.

Strain FF9T (Table 1 ) was isolated from this blood culture by culture on 5% sheep's blood–enriched Columbia agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Identification was not obtained using MALDI-TOF because the scores obtained by this strain were low [23].

A sulfate-reducing bacterium isolated from a creek sediment and capable of metabolizing TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) using sulfate and nitrate as electron acceptors was tentatively characterized as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain A. The isolate was unable to use TNT as the sole source of carbon. TNT degradation was accomplished by a co-metabolic process using pyruvate as the main substrate. Two different metabolic steps were employed by this isolate under different electron-accepting conditions. Under sulfate-reducing conditions, TNT was reduced to 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene and 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene. In contrast, under nitrate-reducing conditions, these amino compounds were not produced, instead, butyric acid was identified as the major metabolite of TNT metabolism. This organism also used a wide variety of other carbon sources, including ethanol, lactate, succinate, formate and malate.

E. amylovora was pathogenic at the three assayed temperatures, with a slow-down of symptom development correlating with colder temperatures and slower growth rates. Siderophore secretion and motility also decreased in parallel to incubation temperatures. However, production of the exopolysaccharides amylovoran and levan was enhanced at 4 °C and 14 °C, respectively. Similarly, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance were improved at 14 °C, with this temperature also favoring the maintenance of culturability, together with a reduction in cell size and the acquisition of rounded shapes in E. amylovora cells subjected to long-term starvation. However, starvation at 28 °C and 4 °C induced an enhanced viable but nonculturable (VBNC) response (to a lesser extent at 4 °C). This work reveals E. amylovora as a highly adaptable pathogen that retains its pathogenic potential even at the minimal growth temperatures, with an improved exopolysaccharide synthesis, biofilm formation or oxidative stress resistance at 14 °C, with respect to the optimal growth temperature (28 °C). Finally, our results also demonstrate the thermal modulation of starvation responses in E. amylovora, suggesting that the starvation-survival and the VBNC states are part of its life cycle.

An evolutionary model proposes that the monocluster type ferredoxins have evolved from the dicluster type by deletion of the second cluster and the emergence of a longer α-helix (α2) in order to maintain a stable tertiary fold. Divergent evolution of FdBt and the other monocluster ferredoxins is the likely cause for the presence of the additional loop and the C-terminal extension in FdBt (Fukuyama et al. 1988, 1989). The twofold symmetry axis observed in the dicluster ferredoxins has been lost in the monocluster ferredoxins during evolution (Fig. 3a and c). An alternative evolutionary hypothesis was proposed recently on the basis of the observation that all known ferredoxins from early representatives of different phylogenetic domains contain a single [4Fe–4S] cluster. According to this hypothesis, dicluster ferredoxins have evolved from the monocluster type by the development of a second cluster binding site (Darimont and Sterner, 1994). 3.2.1 The structural basis for ferredoxin thermostability In addition to the ferredoxin structures from two mesophilic (FdDg, FdDa) and one moderately thermophilic organism (FdBt), three ferredoxin structures from hyperthermophilic organisms are available (optimal growth temperature in parenthesis): P. furiosus (100°C), T. litoralis (90°C) and T. maritima (80°C).", "id": 1075, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thiocapsa litoralis?", "synonym_description": "Thiocapsa litoralis is also known as T. litoralis.

The reb operon is highly expressed in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate at temperatures lower than the optimum growth temperatures (37–38°C). 2-oxoglutarate has been found to inhibit the binding of PraR to the promoter region of the reb operon, but it is still unclear how temperature effects reb operon expression. Therefore, the purpose of our research is to clarify the temperature-depending expression mechanism. In this study, we found that PenR, which is a LysR-type transcriptional regulator of a class A β-lactamase gene (penA), is involved in reb operon expression. The reb operon of the praR mutant was highly expressed at 37°C, but not at 38°C, while the reb operon of the praR penR mutant was highly expressed even at 38°C.

These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5]. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (65°C) has both archaeol- and caldarchaeol-based lipids, while the mesophilic species of Methanobacterium (37°C) has almost the same core lipid composition. Similarly, some archaea that have caldarchaeol-based (tetraether-type) polar lipids in addition to archaeol-based polar lipids grow above 85°C, and there is one that grows at 20°C. Some archaea have only archaeol-based (diether-type) polar lipids and grow below 40°C, yet there is one that grows at 90°C.

Methods: The chromium tolerance of isolates assessed through both agar dilution and broth microdilution methods. Isolates were identified by morphological and biochemical analysis. The tolerance of isolates to cadmium, nickel, lead, and vanadium and also their multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile were determined. Then the top isolate was characterized via 16S rRNA sequencing and its growth temperature and pH were optimized.

The ability of strain HRV44T to utilize not only nitrate but N2O might be one of the niche partitioning strategies for environmental adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal environments where many chemolithoautotrophs utilize nitrate as electron acceptors. N2O emission from the environments is a gross result of the balance between its production and consumption. Although redox gradient around deep-sea hydrothermal vent is conductive to microbial denitrification and nitrification, its contribution to N2O level at deep sea is quite low (Bange and Andreae, 1999). Our results imply members of the genus Nitratiruptor can significantly contribute to the capacity of N2O mitigation of the environments and the magnitude of contribution on the total N2O sink might differ at species or strain levels and be influenced by environmental factors. In addition, not all denitrifying microorganisms might account for the N2O emission as members of Nitratiruptor can utilize exogenous N2O in this study. In deep-sea hydrothermal environments, denitrifying mesophiles and nitrifying microorganisms likely appeared to be the biological sources of excess N2O observed in previous biogeochemical studies (Lilley et al., 1982; Kawagucci et al., 2010). Further comprehensive omics and physiological analysis of deep-sea hydrothermal vent microorganisms will lead us to evaluate the accurate N2O flux in these environments and their contribution to mediate climate change.

(2014) also proved that M. guilliermondii could produce various fatty acids from different carbon sources including glucose, methanol and ethanol. However, there are only few systematic reviews in terms of physiological and genomic characteristics and metabolite synthesis of M. guilliermondii. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to comprehensively summarize and provide information about the characteristics, physiology and important biological applications of M. guilliermondii. 2 Biochemical characteristics and physiology of M. guilliermondii 2.1 Physiological characteristics of M. guilliermondii At the early twentieth century, M. guilliermondii was first described as Endomyces guilliermondii by Castellani (1912). Later, it was classified as Candida guilliermondii for a long time, and its teleomorph of P. guilliermondii was considered to be a genetic heterocomplex, which is composed of many phenotypically indistinguishable groups. In the past 20 years, electrophoretic karyotype analysis and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)/26S rRNA sequence comparisons were comprehensively investigated to identify the taxonomic group of P. guilliermondii (Ann, et al., 2005; Desnos-Ollivier et al., 2008; Savini et al., 2011; Yamamura et al., 2009). Later, the teleomorph strains originally belonging to C. guilliermondii was represented with P. guilliermondii (Lodder and Rij, 1970; Wickerham, 1966; Wickerham and Burton, 1954), indicating that C. guilliermondii with a sexual life cycle should be named P. guilliermondii. The relationship between different strains can also be determined by their nucleotide levels. The nucleotide sequences cloned from the well mated strain P. guilliermondii L2 showed 99.4–99.8% homology with C. guilliermondii ATCC6260. These two strains both belong to the so-called “fungal CTG clade”: yeasts that translate CTG into serine rather than leucine (Butler et al., 2009; Fitzpatrick et al., 2006; Sibirny, 1996). However, M. guilliermondii was later named as the newly assigned teleomorph species (Kurtzman and Suzuki, 2010). For clarity, M. guilliermondii was used throughoutly in this review. As an experimental strain, M. guilliermondii belongs to biosafety level 1, which has two traditional mating types a and α. Recently, the identification of MAT locus in M. guilliermondii showed that there was no a1 gene in the MATa allele and α2 gene in the MATα allele. However, formal genetic tools still can be used (Sibirny, 1996) since M. guilliermondii retains a complete sexual cycle (Butler et al., 2009; (Heitman et al., 2009). M. guilliermondii has a relatively small genome with size of approximately 10.6 Mb. The predicted number of genes (5920 in total) was similar to that of CTG clade species in other fungi because of the short interval between genes, which was 426 bp on average in the genome of M. guilliermondii (Butler et al., 2009). M. guilliermondii is widely distributed in nature. In most cases, it can be isolated from soil, plants, water and air (Sibirny, 1996; Zharova et al., 1980; Zharova et al., 1977), and even some immunodeficiency patients (Pfaller and Diekema, 2007; Pfaller et al., 2009). M. guilliermondii is a typical aerobic microorganism, which cannot grow under the strict anaerobic conditions.

Although the mycelia growth rate was lower at 34°C compared with optimum temperature at 25°C, the respiration rate was higher at 34°C (Fig. 2). The consumption of oxygen of mycelia at 34°C increased by 25.5% compared to 25°C according to the respiration rate.

These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids.

Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5].

Highly thermostable lipases are mostly produced by thermophilic bacteria, although some mesophilic bacteria like Burkholderia cepacia [14], Pseudomonas [15,16], and Amycolatopsis mediterranei [17], have also been reported to produce thermostable enzymes, including a hyperthermophilic enzyme from Pseudomonas [18]. Despite the large number of microbial lipases identified, cloned, and characterized to date, they are still narrowed to a small portion of the microbial diversity. Scarce information concerning the lipases of the genus Janibacter is available. A few strains have been isolated from different environments and have shown lipolytic activity [19,20]. Recently, a mono and di-acyl glycerol lipase MAJ1 from Janibacter HTCC2649, belonging to Family I.7, has been isolated and characterized. The optimum activity of this enzyme occurred at pH 7.0 and 30°C, and it retained 50% of the optimum activity at 5°C, indicating that MAJ1 is a cold-active lipase [21]. Janibacter strains are halotolerant microorganisms [22,23], and thus, they can constitute a source of halophilic enzymes. In addition to thermostable lipases, halophilic enzymes are also interesting for biotechnological applications [24]. Their ability to work in the presence of low water activity could be useful in harsh industrial environments where enzymatic reactions need to be carried out in organic solvents or in the presence of other chemicals. Janibacter sp. strain R02 (BNM 560) was previously isolated in our laboratory from an Antartic soil sample. A remarkable trait of this strain was its high extracellular lipolytic activity, thus being a good candidate for lipase prospection. Herein we describe the identification, cloning, expression and characterization of a novel esterase, LipJ2, from Janibacter sp. R02. This enzyme displays an optimal temperature of 80°C, being extremely thermostable. In addition, it is alkalophilic and halophilic, constituting the first report of an extremophilic enzyme described from the genus Janibacter. The discovery of LipJ2 and the knowledge of its particular characteristics, along with a phylogenetic and structural analysis, provided evidence to propose the existence of a new family of bacterial lipases. Following the criteria and the nomenclature established by Arpigny and Jaeger [1], LipJ2 would be the first member assigned to a newly proposed bacterial lipase family designated as family XVII [25,26]. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Strains and growth conditions Janibacter sp. R02 was isolated from an Antarctic soil sample. Lipolyitic activity was assayed in Rhodamine-Olive Oil plates and by hydrolysis of triolein with the extracellular enzyme fraction. Identification of the strain was performed by physiological test and 16S rRNA sequencing. Growth curves were performed in TSB, at 150rpm, at 20, 28 and 35°C respectively, and the optimal growth temperature was determined to be 28°C. The strain was routinely grown in Tryptic Soy (TSA) agar plates at 28°C for 24h and in TSB broth at 28°C and 150rpm for 48h.

[12] introduced the usefulness of RNA polymerase beta subunit encoding gene (rpoB) sequences for the identification of members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The analyses of rpoB sequences were also used as a criterion to propose the genus Raoultella as a new genus of the Enterobacteriaceae with 6% rpoB sequence dissimilarity as a reasonable limit to differentiate genera [2]. A 555bp sequence of strain D5/23T was compared with the sequences from data bases. A neighbor-joining analysis is shown in Fig. 2 . The highest similarities of the rpoB sequence were shown with E. cowanii CIP 107300T (AJ566944, 93.0%). To the rpoB sequences from all other strains shown in Fig. 2, only 91% similarity or lower values were found. The results of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses and rpoB gene sequence analysis in addition to DNA–DNA hybridization experiments and phenotypic characterization indicate that the strain represents a new species of the genus Enterobacter.

In addition, from comparing the two strains with other Alteromonas species, the identities of five housekeeping genes belonging to strains P0211T were lower than 80%, and the identities of five house-keeping genes belonging to strain P0213T were lower than 81% (Table S3). The five house-keeping genes revealed a threshold value of 98.9% that could be considered as the species cut-off value for the delineation of Alteromonas spp. [9,10]. These values supported the classification of the two isolates within the genus Alteromonas, representing two as yet undescribed species of this genus. The isolates were screened for copper tolerance, and genome analysis demonstrated the existence of genes associated with copper resistance, including cutA, cutE, cusA, cusB, copD, cusR, and cpxA/cpxR (Table S4). It has been reported previously that these genes confer resistance against high levels of copper, and a mutation in one or more of these genes results in an increased copper sensitivity. Moreover, we found that these copper resistance genes, including cut, cus, cop, and cpxA/cpxR, are also widely present in other Alteromonas genomes (Table S4). The major fatty acids (relative amount >10%) found in the two strains were identified as C16:1 ω7c/iso-C15:0 2-OH and C16:0. As expected, the isolates and reference strains shared similar fatty acid profiles, but the relative amount of some fatty acids in the two strains was different compared with the reference strains (Table 3 ).

In hyperthermophilic archaea, however, TIM exists as a tetramer composed of monomers that are about 10% shorter than other eucaryal and bacterial TIM monomers. We report here the crystal structure of TIM from Thermoproteus tenax, a hyperthermophilic archaeon that has an optimum growth temperature of 86°C. The structure was determined from both a hexagonal and an orthorhombic crystal form to resolutions of 2.5 Å and 2.3 Å, and refined to R-factors of 19.7% and 21.5%, respectively. In both crystal forms, T. tenax TIM exists as a tetramer of the familiar (βα) 8-barrel. In solution, however, and unlike other hyperthermophilic TIMs, the T. tenax enzyme exhibits an equilibrium between inactive dimers and active tetramers, which is shifted to the tetramer state through a specific interaction with glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase of T. tenax. This observation is interpreted in physiological terms as a need to reduce the build-up of thermolabile metabolic intermediates that would be susceptible to destruction by heat. A detailed structural comparison with TIMs from organisms with growth optima ranging from 15°C to 100°C emphasizes the importance in hyperthermophilic proteins of the specific location of ionic interactions for thermal stability rather than their numbers, and shows a clear correlation between the reduction of heat-labile, surface-exposed Asn and Gln residues with thermoadaptation.

The proteins have 58% sequence identity and a highly similar tertiary structure [21]. By performing MD simulations and thermal unfolding measurements of these trHbs, we were able to address a new mechanism through which these proteins acquire thermostability, helping to understand the differences between thermostable and non-thermostable proteins. We studied the wild type (wt) and E3-swapped mutants, in which the residues at position E3 (Pro of Tf-trHbO and Gly in Mt-trHbO) were interchanged in order to test the role of this single residue in the protein thermostability. We propose a mechanism that accounts for the thermostable protein being able to avoid unfolding at high temperatures. The Tf-trHbO has a flexible loop through which it can concentrate most of its fluctuations, thus avoiding the unfolding process. We found that the flexibility of the loop can be controlled by the presence of a proline residue. The lack of a flexible loop in the non-thermostable protein spreads the fluctuations over the entire protein, especially the termini, thus starting the protein unfolding process at high temperatures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Computer simulations Crystal structures of both wt trHbs, Tf-trHbO (PDB ID: 2BMM [21]) and Mt-trHbO (PDB ID: 1NGK [22]) were used as starting points for the MD simulations.

Thermostable pullulanases from type II (amylopullulanases) are being used in starch liquefaction and saccharification combined [133,68]. The hyperthermophilic archaea Staphylothermus marinus, an isolate from the deep-sea associated with geothermal activity or hydrothermal vents, presents an optimum growth at 98°C. A new thermostable amylopullulanase of the glycosyl hydrolase family from S. marinus, has recently been described with degradation activity towards pullulan and cyclodextrin at 105°C [134]. One of the most thermostable and thermo-active pullulanases type II has been reported for Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis active at 130°C to 140°C in the presence of 5mM Ca2+ [135].", "id": 1097, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Staphylothermus marinus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2280+Staphylothermus marinus"}

RFL1109 The unknown bacterium (refered to as RFL1109) was isolated from an air sample at Arabat Spit (Arabatskaja Strelka), Crimea, Ukraine. Preliminary characterized as Listeria sp., it was found to be a producer of restriction endonucleases (REases) Lsp1109I and Lsp1109II (Janulaitis, Grigaite, Trinkunaite, Maneliene, Bitinaite, Kiuduliene and Butkus, unpublished). After more profound investigation (see below) the strain was reclassified as Exiguobacterium arabatum sp. nov. RFL1109. The small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequence of the strain RFL1109 was determined and compared with the NCBI nucleotide collection. The comparison resulted in multiple hits with sequences of different Exiguobacterium species (data not shown). Moreover, a subsequent phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the strain RFL1109 is phylogenetically affiliated to the genus Exiguobacterium (Fig. 1 ). A number of morphological and biochemical tests was conducted to compare properties of RFL1109 and other Exiguobacterium species (Table 1 ). We found that the RFL1109 cells are Gram-variable and facultatively anaerobic; cell growth is better under aerobic conditions. Colonies are circular, glossy, raised, 3–4mm in diameter after incubation for 2 days on LB agar at 37°C under aerobic conditions. Cells are rod-shaped (0.6–0.8×1.2–2.0μm) and with peritrichous flagella.

In 1984, DNA–DNA hybridisation and 16S rRNA sequencing studies indicated that the species Streptococcus faecium and S. faecalis were sufficiently distinct from other streptococci, and Schleifer and Kilpper-Bälz (1984) proposed their transfer to the genus Enterococcus. To date, 28 species, namely E. asini, E. avium, E. canis, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. columbae, E. dispar, E. durans, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. flavescens, E. gallinarum, E. gilvus, E. haemoperoxidus, E. hirae, E. malodoratus, E. moraviensis, E. mundtii, E. pallens, E. phoeniculicola, E. pseudoavium, E. raffinosus, E. ratti, E. saccharolyticus, E. saccharominimus, E. solitarius, E. sulfureus, and E. villorum, have been added to the genus on the basis of phylogenetic evidence strengthened by 16S rRNA DNA sequencing and/or DNA–DNA hybridization studies. However, some reclassifications may occur in the near future. For instance, E. flavescens and E. casseliflavus have insufficient differences to be classified separately (Devriese and Pot, 1995; Descheemaeker et al., 1997), and E. avillorum is an earlier heterotypic synonym of E. porcinus (De Graef et al., 2003).

D2-3T was the sole isolate that displayed these colony morphologies. Gram-stained [23] cells were inspected under a Zeiss Axioskop 2 light microscope with an AxioCam MRm camera. Cells of D2-3T were Gram-negative cocci with a diameter of 1.5–2.1μm and typically appeared in pairs (Fig. 1a ). Cells for electron microscopy (and for all other tests) were grown in liquid medium containing 2.2g Red Sea salt L−1, 5mM NaNO3, 10mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), trace element and B-vitamin solution (1mL each L−1), 0.5g yeast extract L−1, fatty acid mix (sodium acetate×3H2O, sodium lactate, sodium propionate, and sodium butyrate [final concentrations in the medium were 1.25mM each]), and 2mM glucose. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10min at 2000g), negatively stained with uranyl acetate [28], and examined with a CEM 902A transmission electron microscope (Zeiss). Pili or flagella were not observed (Fig. 1b). Cells in liquid culture preferentially grew attached to the wall of the flask. The almost full-length (1353bp) 16S rRNA gene of D2-3T was amplified directly by colony-PCR using primer pair 27F and 1492R [14], and PCR products were commercially sequenced (Macrogene, Korea). The program package ARB [17] was used for phylogenetic analysis with neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood algorithms for tree reconstruction [16]. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of D2-3T formed, together with a few environmental sequences (e.g., an uncultured bacterium from zebrafish gut [accession number DQ814256]), a distinct lineage within the α-1 Proteobacteria. The closest described relatives were a group of filamentous Alphaproteobacteria that were characterized in situ and associated with bulking problems in wastewater treatment plants [15]. The only cultivated representative of this group was Candidatus “Alysiosphaera europaea” (90.8% sequence similarity to D2-3T), which has to be co-cultured with a yeast [24].

The membranous and cytoplasmic fractions of D2-3T yielded absorbance maxima at 430, 531, 562nm (Fig. S1) and 430, 536, 665nm, respectively, which were indicative of b-type cytochromes. Spreading (i.e., the width) of the α- and β-peaks and the shoulder of the γ-peak suggested that c- and a-type cytochromes were also present. Cultures of D2-3T that were grown aerobically in the light were pinkish. Methanol/acetone extracts [11] of aerobic cultures displayed absorbance maxima (470–480, 498, and 520–530nm) indicative of carotenoids (Fig. S2). In contrast, cultures of D2-3T that were grown in the dark were almost colorless, and methanol/acetone extracts of such cultures did not display such absorbance maxima. A small absorbance peak at 750–770nm was detected in methanol/acetone extracts of cells grown in both the absence and presence of light, which was indicative of bacteriochlorophyll a.

Plaats-Niterink (1981) grouped P. pleroticum with other Pythium spp. producing globose hyphal swelling and plerotic oospores; however, the status of P. pleroticum remains uncertain and should perhaps be renamed. The only heterothallic Pythium on the list of species associated with PSR is Pythium splendens.

In both the consortium, only thermophilic bacteria were included in order to ensure the survival of the selected bacteria during the thermophilic phase, at which the impact of oil is high. The starting inoculums were prepared by mixing of each strain in equal volume (Awasthi et al., 2014) to a final volume of 200.0ml to obtain the multifunctional BC-1 (optical density of ∼1 and 6.3×108 CFU/ml) and oil degrading BC-2 (optical density of ∼1 and 6.9×107 CFU/ml) consortium. Then both the consortium were separately mixed with sawdust and used in the composting experiments. Optimal pH and temperature for the growth of above selected strains were 6.5–8.5 and 60°C, respectively. In the control treatment, 200.0ml of sterile nutrient medium was supplied. 2.3 Composter and operations PCFW was composted in bench-scale computer controlled 20-L stainless steel reactors in which the temperature was monitored and recorded automatically. The detailed structure and operation of the composters were reported in an earlier publication (Wong et al., 2009). Each composter was loaded with 7.5kg (wet weight) of the compost mix including PCFW, saw dust and 10% zeolite on dry weight basis (Chan et al., 2016); while 500.0g plastic sphere was also added to adjust the bulk density and composted for 56days. As mentioned above, the experiment included three treatments: T-1 (Control), T-2 (inoculated with multifunctional bacterial consortium [BC-1]) and T-3 (inoculated with oil degrading bacterial consortium [BC-2]). The CO2 evolved from the composter was measured on-line using WMA-2 gas analyzers (PP systems, Herts, UK), and the data were continuously recorded in the computer. Based on our preliminary experiment (Wang et al., 2013, 2016a), aeration was provided at a flow rate 0.5L/min/kg dry weight through an aerator pump. To evaluate the NH3 emission, the NH3 in the outlet gas was absorbed in boric acid and the concentration was determined titrimetrically (Komilis and Ham, 2006). 2.4 Analyses Samples were collected throughout the process at 10 critical periods driven by temperature changes during the study period. The composting mass inside the reactor was taken out during the sampling days and mixed thoroughly in a large vessel with the addition of water to restore the moisture content, after that, 150.0g of the sample was collected for the analysis. In this study1:5 ratio of water extracts of the fresh compost sample was used for pH, extractable ammonium, and cress seed germination test; while total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), total sodium (TNa) and total potassium (TK) were analyzed using dried and powdered samples, as per the standard methods for testing of compost materials (TMECC, 2002). The final matured compost was also analyzed for Salmonella sp. and Fecal coliforms as per standard method (TMECC, 2002). The solid phase soxhlet extraction method 5520B (APHA, 2005), was used for the analysis of oil content in the composting mass. For each extraction, 20.0g of sample was mixed with 5g anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solid–liquid extraction (1:1) was performed using 150.0mln-hexane solvent, the solvents were evaporated using rotary evaporator and the residual oil was estimated gravimetrically. 2.5 Characterization of the bacteria The DNA was extracted from the selected strains using QIAGEN DNA extraction kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene from each isolate was amplified by PCR with a universal primer set; forward 10F primer 5′-AGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ and 1507r reverse primer 5′-TACCTTGTTACGACTTCACCCCA-3′ (Muyzer et al., 1993). PCR amplification was performed in a 25μl reaction containing 12.5μl 2×Taq PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN), 5.5μl milli-Q water, 1.0μl each primer (Tech Dragon, Hong Kong) and 5.0μl template DNA.", "id": 972, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Brevibacillus borstelensis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "45462+Brevibacillus borstelensis"}

Crc acts by binding to target mRNAs, inhibiting their translation. In Pseudomonas putida, the amount of free Crc available is controlled by two sRNAs, CrcY and CrcZ, which bind to and sequester Crc. The levels of these sRNAs vary according to metabolic conditions. Pseudomonas putida grows optimally at 30°C, but can also thrive at 10°C. The present work shows that when cells grow exponentially at 10°C, the repressive effect of Crc on many genes is significantly reduced compared with that seen at 30°C. Total Crc levels were similar at both temperatures, but those of CrcZ and CrcY were significantly higher at 10°C. Therefore, Crc-mediated repression may, at least in part, be reduced at 10°C because the fraction of Crc protein sequestered by CrcZ and CrcY is larger, reducing the amount of free Crc available to bind its targets. This may help P.putida to face cold stress.

The OH at the C1 may bind a polar head group and the OH at the C2 binds the first hydrocarbon chain, and the C3 and C4 represent a C–C-bond between the “backbone” and the remainder part of the long chain.)) from Thermomicrobium roseum (75°C [12]); cyclohexyl fatty acid (Figure 1(n)) from Bacillus acidocaldarius (65°C [13]). These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5]. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (65°C) has both archaeol- and caldarchaeol-based lipids, while the mesophilic species of Methanobacterium (37°C) has almost the same core lipid composition. Similarly, some archaea that have caldarchaeol-based (tetraether-type) polar lipids in addition to archaeol-based polar lipids grow above 85°C, and there is one that grows at 20°C. Some archaea have only archaeol-based (diether-type) polar lipids and grow below 40°C, yet there is one that grows at 90°C.

At 15 °C temperature normal growth was not found in agreement with Vonshak and Torzillo [61]. It has been suggested that changes in cytoplasmic viscosity under low temperature condition is responsible for less efficient carbon utilization and reduced electron transport at a given photon flux rate [62]. At low temperature, Dunaliella salina exhibited increase in fatty acid unsaturation, altered fluidity of cell membrane and considerable impact on efficiency of photosynthetic machinery [63]. Moreover at 35 °C temperature, there was significant decrease in growth and H2 output was noticed in both the species (Fig. 6). Though overall growth was diminished at 35 °C, comparatively C. minutum proved best with respect to H2 production. Depending on the species, the growth rate alters with increasing temperature i.e. above critical level [64]. In addition certain enzymes may works in ambient temperature, but there is high possibility of modification in activity at high temperature. Higher temperatures reduce protein synthesis, accumulate more free amino acids and consequently decreased growth rate was observed in Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Ulva pertusa [19].

CpkA, which contains tandem repeats of a GGM motif, shows its highest ATPase activity at 60°C to 70°C, whereas CpkB shows its highest activity at temperatures higher than 90°C. To clarify the effects of changes in ATPase activity on chaperonin function at lower temperatures, various CpkA variants were constructed by introducing single point mutations into the C-terminal region. A CpkA variant in which Glu530 was replaced with Gly (CpkA-E530G) showed increased ATPase activity, with its highest activity at 50°C. The efficacy of the CpkA variants against denatured indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase of T. kodakarensis (TrpCTk), which is a CpkA target, was then examined in vitro. CpkA-E530G was more effective than wild-type CpkA at facilitating the refolding of chemically unfolded TrpCTk at 50°C.

The present study addressed the genus Marichromatium in which all strains except the type strain M. bheemlicum JA124T shared >99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Therefore, they constituted what has been described as a microdiverse ribotype (i.e., a cluster with less than 1% sequence divergence) [1]. In this context, we carried out a multi-gene based phylogenetic analysis. This was even more important since among the examined Marichromatium strains remarkable phenotypic differences were only found for a newly reported strain of M. gracile biotype thermosulfidiphilum DSM 21765 [33].

P. graminicola was first isolated and described from wheat roots in India and this Pythium species is believed to be pathogenic only on graminaceous plants by Chen and Hoy (1993), Martin (2008) and Plaats-Niterink (1981). However, others have described it as a causal agent of PSR on ginger in Fiji and India (Lomavatu et al., 2009; Philip, 2005; Ramakrishnan, 1949). P. zingiberis which was first reported to cause PSR in Japan, has so far only been reported in one other country causing PSR on ginger, that being Korea. Although the pathogen supposedly has a narrow host range limited to ginger and its close relatives (Samejima and Ichitani, 1988), it was also found to cause damping off on cabbage seedlings in Japan (Kubota and Abiko, 2000) and, interestingly, it was also recorded on leeches (Hirudinea) in Poland (Czeczuga et al., 2003). The record of P. zingiberis on leeches was based solely on morphological comparisons to the species as it appears in Dick's (1990) key and so perhaps should be accepted with caution. Hopefully additional discoveries of this unique host/pathogen interaction will allow for more complete analysis via contemporary phylogenetics. P. myriotylum, which was first isolated from tomato, is very similar to P. zingiberis in terms of morphology and some gene sequences (Levesque and De Cock, 2004; Matsumoto et al., 1999); it is however known to have a worldwide distribution and attacks numerous hosts (Plaats-Niterink, 1981). Stirling (2004) and Stirling et al. (2009) observed that disease severity caused by P. myriotylum on ginger was strongly influenced by temperature rather than soil moisture. The pathogen was also very aggressive on ginger showing symptoms on above ground parts of plants within a week from inoculation (Wang et al., 2003; Stirling et al., 2009). Additionally, another species called Pythium volutum was also considered to be synonymous with P. zingiberis by Plaats-Niterink (1981), but it is in fact quite distinct based on the cardinal temperature and oospore size according to Dick (1990) and Takahashi (1954a). P. aphanidermatum and P. deliense are both common pathogens on many crops in warm regions. Morphologically they are similar in their production of inflated sporangia, in their antheridial mode and size of the oogonium (Dick, 1990; Plaats-Niterink, 1981), and they differ only by 3% within their ITS sequences (Levesque and De Cock, 2004). Nonetheless, with slight differences in optimal growing temperature and a morphology characterised by a consistent bending of the oogonialphore towards the antheridium by P. deliense, the two species remain as two separate taxa (Dick, 1990; Herrero and Klemsdal, 1998; Plaats-Niterink, 1981). Both P. aphanidermatum and P. deliense can be distinguished by either RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analysis (Herrero and Klemsdal, 1998) or with multiplex PCR with specific primer sets (Arif et al., 2011). Pythium spinosum has been recovered from rotten ginger rhizomes collected in Australia and Japan (Table 1), but when pathogenicity was tested on living ginger plants, no symptoms developed (Le et al., 2010). However, when P. spinosum was inoculated onto excised sections of ginger rhizome it fully colonised the tissue within 3 days when incubated at 27 °C.", "id": 1049, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Pythium graminicola?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "82937+Pythium graminicola"}

However, it is interesting that the growth rate of the strain showed a better resistance toward the low temperature (OD600 was maintained at 0.28 even at 10 °C), although Cr(VI) reduction was not excellent. In the report of Pereira and Ramaiah (2019), better growth of Staphylococcus sp. and Staphylococcus arlettae was observed, although at 20 °C, this is likely due to the ionization of related moieties, cell wall stability and its configuration being affected, thus reducing Cr(VI) removal efficiency (Congeevaram et al., 2007). Additionally, thermodynamic analysis was conducted to further explain the effect of temperature on Cr(VI) reduction and obtain the reduction rate constants at different temperatures (Table S3). The results showed that the rate constant obtained at 30 °C was substantially higher than those obtained at other temperatures, which is in accordance with the performance of Cr(VI) reduction at different temperatures.", "id": 903, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Staphylococcus saprophyticus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "29385+Staphylococcus saprophyticus"}

On the basis of these data, we propose the creation of Bacillus ndiopicus sp. nov. Keywords Bacillus ndiopicus genome Senegal skin taxonogenomics Introduction Bacillus subtilis was the first type species described in the genus Bacillus (Cohn 1872) [1]. Currently there are 301 species and seven subspecies with validly published names [2]. Generally members of this genus are environmental bacteria present in soil, food, and fresh and sea water. In humans, some strains can be pathogenic, such as Bacillus cereus (associated mainly with food poisoning) and Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax) [3–5]. Other strains are saprophytes [6]. Several Bacillus species are also isolated from different plants in which they are endophytes [7]. Recently high-throughput genome sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses of bacteria have given unprecedented access to an abundance of genetic and proteomic information [8–10]. Currently a polyphasic approach is performed to describe new bacterial taxa, including their genome sequence, matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) spectrum, and major phenotypic characteristics such as Gram staining, culture, metabolic characteristics, habitat and (if applicable) pathogenicity [9,10]. Bacillus ndiopicus strain FF3T (= CSUR P3025 = DSM 27837) is designated as the type strain of Bacillus ndiopicus. This bacterium is a Gram-positive rod that is aeroanaerobic.

MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex spectrometer; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was first performed to try to identify the bacterium [10]. In brief, 1.5 μL of matrix solution containing diluted α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 500 μL acetonitrile, 250 μL 10% trifluoroacetic acid and 250 μL HPLC water was deposited on each spot for ionization and crystallization. All protein spectra obtained were compared with those of the MALDI-TOF database. If the score was greater than or equal to 1.9, the strain was considered identified. Otherwise, the identification failed. When MALDI-TOF MS failed, bacterial identification was performed using 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification in combination with sequencing as previously described [11]. Strain ND3T exhibited 92.4% of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Sutterella wadsworthensis strain SW4, which is the phylogenetically closest species with a validly published name [12]. As Stackebrant [13] suggested, if the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity value was lower than 98.7% or 95%, the strain was defined as a new species or genus respectively, without performing DNA-DNA hybridization [14]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from other Sutterellaceae family members. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW, and phylogenetic references were obtained using the maximum-likelihood method within the MEGA software (Fig. 1 ). The MALDI-TOF MS analysis of proteins was also performed, as previously described, to generate a reference spectrum.

One such organism is the Gram-negative, non-pathogenic marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens, which is commonly found in marine and coastal waters and sediments, and has a reported doubling time of 10min or less when cultured under ideal conditions in rich medium (Eagon, 1962). V. natriegens (initially called Pseudomonas natriegens) was described for the first time by Payne et al. in the early 1960s (Payne et al., 1961). It is a moderate halophile, requiring about 1.5% NaCl for optimal growth, and grows well under laboratory conditions with glucose as the carbon source, with an optimal growth temperature of 37°C (Eagon, 1962; Lee et al., 2016). Two annotated genomes are available for V. natriegens, for strains ATCC 12048 (Wang et al., 2013) and DSMZ 759 (Maida et al., 2013). Recently, a wide range of genetic tools were developed and described to engineer V. natriegens (Weinstock et al., 2016), and the fast growth of this species was shown to reduce the time needed to execute common cloning pipelines, which has clear advantages in highly iterative strain building efforts (Weinstock et al., 2016).

The proteins have 58% sequence identity and a highly similar tertiary structure [21]. By performing MD simulations and thermal unfolding measurements of these trHbs, we were able to address a new mechanism through which these proteins acquire thermostability, helping to understand the differences between thermostable and non-thermostable proteins. We studied the wild type (wt) and E3-swapped mutants, in which the residues at position E3 (Pro of Tf-trHbO and Gly in Mt-trHbO) were interchanged in order to test the role of this single residue in the protein thermostability. We propose a mechanism that accounts for the thermostable protein being able to avoid unfolding at high temperatures. The Tf-trHbO has a flexible loop through which it can concentrate most of its fluctuations, thus avoiding the unfolding process. We found that the flexibility of the loop can be controlled by the presence of a proline residue. The lack of a flexible loop in the non-thermostable protein spreads the fluctuations over the entire protein, especially the termini, thus starting the protein unfolding process at high temperatures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Computer simulations Crystal structures of both wt trHbs, Tf-trHbO (PDB ID: 2BMM [21]) and Mt-trHbO (PDB ID: 1NGK [22]) were used as starting points for the MD simulations.

A previous work (Vaquera et al., 2014) showed that A. arborescens had an optimum growth temperature of 30°C which is higher than that reported for A. alternata (21°C). Regarding toxin production, Pose et al. (2010) analyzed the effect of temperature and aw on mycotoxin production by A. alternata isolated from tomatoes (See Table 2 ). AOH biosynthesis by A. alternata was optimum at 0.954 aw and 21°C, while for A. arborescens the optimum aw level detected in this work was 0.975, with 477μg/kg of AOH detected at 30°C, although a high concentration of AOH was also produced at 0.95 and 25°C (361μg/kg).The biosynthesis of AME by A. alternata was optimum at 0.954 aw and 35°C; for A. arborescens, high temperatures (30°C) also proved to be more favorable for its accumulation, although a significantly higher concentration of this toxin was detected at 0.975 aw than at 0.95 aw. TeA was optimally produced by A. alternata at 0.982 aw and 21°C, meanwhile for A. arborescens lower water activities (0.975, 0.95) and higher temperatures (25, 30°C) resulted in higher toxin accumulation. Hasan (1995) studied the influence of temperature on mycotoxin production by A. alternata when cultured on liquid and tomato homogenate. The optimum for AOH and AME was 28°C in both cultures, which are in concordance with our results for A. arborescens, but TeA was produced in large quantities at 21°C by A. alternata, while A. arborescens accumulated more TeA at higher temperatures (25–30°C).", "id": 692, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Alternaria arborescens?", "synonym_description": "Alternaria arborescens is also known as A. arborescens.

However, the link between the regulation of the relevant genes and STXs’ accumulation and temperature is insufficiently understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of temperature on cellular STXs and the expression of two core STX biosynthesis genes (sxtA4 and sxtG) in the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella Alex03 isolated from Korean waters. We analyzed the growth rate, toxin profiles, and gene responses in cells exposed to different temperatures, including long-term adaptation (12, 16, and 20°C) and cold and heat stresses. Temperature significantly affected the growth of A. catenella, with optimal growth (0.49 division/day) at 16°C and the largest cell size (30.5 µm) at 12°C. High concentration of STXs eq were detected in cells cultured at 16°C (86.3 fmol/cell) and exposed to cold stress at 20→12°C (96.6 fmol/cell) compared to those at 20°C and exposed to heat stress. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed significant gene expression changes of sxtA4 in cells cultured at 16°C (1.8-fold) and cold shock at 20→16°C (9.9-fold). In addition, sxtG was significantly induced in cells exposed to cold shocks (20→16°C; 19.5-fold) and heat stress (12→20°C; 25.6-fold). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that low temperature (12 and 16°C) and cold stress were positively related with STXs’ production and gene expression levels. These results suggest that temperature may affect the toxicity and regulation of STX biosynthesis genes in dinoflagellates.", "id": 110, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Alexandrium catenella?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2925+Alexandrium catenella"}

In this work we studied the effect of medium composition on cold adaptation of membrane fluidity. Bacillus subtilis was cultivated at optimum (40 °C) and low (20 °C) temperatures in complex medium with glucose or in mineral medium with either glucose or glycerol. Cold adaptation was characterized by fatty acid analysis and by measuring the midpoint of phospholipid phase transition Tm (differential scanning calorimetry) and membrane fluidity (DPH fluorescence polarization). Cells cultured and measured at 40 °C displayed the same membrane fluidity in all three media despite a markedly different fatty acid composition. The Tm was surprisingly the highest in the case of a culture grown in complex medium. On the contrary, cultivation at 20 °C in the complex medium gave rise to the highest membrane fluidity with concomitant decrease of Tm by 10.5 °C. In mineral media at 20 °C the corresponding changes of Tm were almost negligible. After a temperature shift from 40 to 20 °C, the cultures from all three media displayed the same adaptive induction of fatty acid desaturase despite their different membrane fluidity values immediately after cold shock. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In both the consortium, only thermophilic bacteria were included in order to ensure the survival of the selected bacteria during the thermophilic phase, at which the impact of oil is high. The starting inoculums were prepared by mixing of each strain in equal volume (Awasthi et al., 2014) to a final volume of 200.0ml to obtain the multifunctional BC-1 (optical density of ∼1 and 6.3×108 CFU/ml) and oil degrading BC-2 (optical density of ∼1 and 6.9×107 CFU/ml) consortium. Then both the consortium were separately mixed with sawdust and used in the composting experiments. Optimal pH and temperature for the growth of above selected strains were 6.5–8.5 and 60°C, respectively. In the control treatment, 200.0ml of sterile nutrient medium was supplied. 2.3 Composter and operations PCFW was composted in bench-scale computer controlled 20-L stainless steel reactors in which the temperature was monitored and recorded automatically. The detailed structure and operation of the composters were reported in an earlier publication (Wong et al., 2009). Each composter was loaded with 7.5kg (wet weight) of the compost mix including PCFW, saw dust and 10% zeolite on dry weight basis (Chan et al., 2016); while 500.0g plastic sphere was also added to adjust the bulk density and composted for 56days. As mentioned above, the experiment included three treatments: T-1 (Control), T-2 (inoculated with multifunctional bacterial consortium [BC-1]) and T-3 (inoculated with oil degrading bacterial consortium [BC-2]). The CO2 evolved from the composter was measured on-line using WMA-2 gas analyzers (PP systems, Herts, UK), and the data were continuously recorded in the computer. Based on our preliminary experiment (Wang et al., 2013, 2016a), aeration was provided at a flow rate 0.5L/min/kg dry weight through an aerator pump. To evaluate the NH3 emission, the NH3 in the outlet gas was absorbed in boric acid and the concentration was determined titrimetrically (Komilis and Ham, 2006). 2.4 Analyses Samples were collected throughout the process at 10 critical periods driven by temperature changes during the study period. The composting mass inside the reactor was taken out during the sampling days and mixed thoroughly in a large vessel with the addition of water to restore the moisture content, after that, 150.0g of the sample was collected for the analysis. In this study1:5 ratio of water extracts of the fresh compost sample was used for pH, extractable ammonium, and cress seed germination test; while total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), total sodium (TNa) and total potassium (TK) were analyzed using dried and powdered samples, as per the standard methods for testing of compost materials (TMECC, 2002). The final matured compost was also analyzed for Salmonella sp. and Fecal coliforms as per standard method (TMECC, 2002).

Such high values were obtained from the coastal fish farm where concentrations of DIN and NH4 + in seawater (0.7–2.7μM and 0.1–2.1μM, respectively) were much lower than those in the tank/pond culture systems which were approximately >10μM for DIN and >5μM for NH4 +. The extremely high growth under relatively low nutrient concentrations suggests the efficient absorption and utilization of DIN by U. ohnoi. In order to remove nutrients efficiently from the water body of fish farms, it is necessary to find biofilters that are adapted to high temperatures, because the amount of nutrients discharged from fish farms increases usually during the warm season due to the increased feeding activity of fish (Yokoyama et al., 2009).

The DNA G+C content of the type strain was 62.2mol%, which agrees with the range described for the genus Aeromonas (57–63mol%) [16]. In the description of A. schubertii [9], the strain CDC 2478-85T later considered as Aeromonas HG 13 was included in the DNA hybridization experiments but it was not considered as belonging to this species due to its level of divergence (70% at 60°C and 61% at 75°C, with a variation of 5%). Other DNA hybridization determinations have shown a low DNA relatedness (<30%) between the type strain of HG13 and some type strains of Aeromonas species [3,6,7,22,26]. Hickman-Brenner et al. [9] also carried out DNA hybridizations with the other strain of the Aeromonas group 501 (strain CDC 2555-87), which was only closely related to strain CDC 2478-85T (87% at 60°C, 86% at 75°C, with a divergence of 1%). These results suggested that the Aeromonas group 501 could constitute a different Aeromonas species [9,17]. The type strain of HG13 was also included in a previous analysis of the FAFLP [22,23]. Cluster analysis of FAFLP fingerprints revealed that the FAFLP pattern of this strain is unique and with a very low genotypic relatedness to other members of the genus Aeromonas (<10%), including A. schubertii. These results allow a clear genotypic discrimination of Aeromonas group 501 from other Aeromonas species. Sequences of cpn60, dnaJ, gyrB and rpoD genes were analyzed independently and concatenated. In all cases, phylogenetic trees generated by neighbour-joining (Jukes–Cantor, Kimura-two-parameter and Tamura–Nei models) and maximum parsimony methods were similar. As shown in the phylogenetic tree obtained from concatenated sequences ( Fig. 2), strains CDC 2478-85T and CDC 2555-87 (HG13) clustered together in a separate phylogenetic line close to A. schubertii (100% bootstrap). These results were similar to other phylogenetic analyses [15,24,27]. Previous studies [24,25,29] have established the following intraspecific threshold values based on divergences of gene sequences: 3.5% for cpn60, 3.3% for dnaJ, 2.3% for gyrB and 2.6% for rpoD. Sequence divergence between strains CDC 2478-85T and CDC 2555-87 was 1.1% for cpn60 and dnaJ, 0.6% for gyrB and 1% for rpoD, indicating that both strains belonged to the same species. Sequence divergence between both HG13 strains and the type strains of all Aeromonas species were higher than the threshold values. Similarly, the Aeromonas group 501 showed divergences of 5.6% for cpn60, 4.9–5.0% for dnaJ, 2.8–3.1% for gyrB and 4.5–4.8% for rpoD with respect to A. schubertii. Nevertheless, divergences observed when comparing with other Aeromonas species were even higher: >10% for cpn60, >7.5% for dnaJ, >9.5% for gyrB and >11.5% for rpoD, confirming that the Aeromonas group 501 represents a novel Aeromonas species.

These culture results were confirmed by field observations of bloom occurrences in the Inland Bays. Maximum nutrient-saturated growth rates (μmax) for C. subsalsa were ∼0.6 d-1 and half-saturation concentrations for growth (K s) were 9 μM for nitrate, 1.5 μM for ammonium, and 0.8 μM for phosphate. μmax of H. akashiwo (∼0.7 d-1) was slightly higher than C. subsalsa, but Ks values were nearly an order of magnitude lower at 0.3 μM for nitrate, 0.3 μM for ammonium, and 0.2 μM for phosphate.

Therefore, Algoriphagus sp. Y33 displayed the capacity of the nitrogen transformations: NO3 − → NO2 − → NH4 + → organic nitrogen. Although complete gene sequencing was performed for Algoriphagus resistens NH1T before, no sequence data was found in NCBI. Then, to our knowledge, this is the first complete genome sequence of Algoriphagus sp. isolated from the shallow water of Indian Ocean. The genomic data allows us to gain considerable information for the nitrogen utilization and transformation of Algoriphagus species, as well as the nitrogen cycle in ocean ecosystem. 2 Data description The strain Y33 was cultured at 25 °C in 50 mL of marine Zobell 2216E medium (peptone, 5 g/L, yeast extract 1 g/L, natural seawater, 1 L) for 48 h at 150 rpm.

In the current study, it was assessed whether the major factors that inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes in Gouda cheese are the factors that determine growth in other types of ready-to-eat cheese as well. Various types of cheeses were selected, some of which had been associated with listeriosis, while others had not. Based on the composition of the different cheese types, the concentrations of undissociated lactic acid were calculated for each type. The ability to support growth of L. monocytogenes was predicted using the Gamma model, based on literature data on total lactic acid content, moisture content, fat content, pH, Aw, and temperature, and optimal growth rates in milk at 30–37 °C. In addition, the actual specific growth rates of L. monocytogenes in the various cheeses were calculated based on available experimental growth data. In 9 out of the 10 RTE cheeses reviewed, the undissociated lactic acid concentrations and aw determined growth/no growth of L. monocytogenes. No growth was correctly predicted for feta, Cheddar and Gouda, and growth was correctly predicted for ricotta, queso fresco, Camembert, high-moisture mozzarella, cottage and blue cheese. Growth of L. monocytogenes was not observed in practice upon inoculation of Emmental, whereas growth in this cheese type was predicted when including the above mentioned factors in the models. Other factors, presumably acetic and propionic acid, are thought to be important to inhibit growth of the pathogen in Emmental. The results from our study show that for cheeses in which lactic acid is a main acid, our model based on undissociated lactic acid, temperature, pH and aw gives a good prediction of potential outgrowth of L. monocytogenes.

This, in combination with the naturally present metal ions in the mixed AIW, and the promotional effect of DC on the process, can lead to good lipid accumulation yields using the proposed renewable substrate and immobilisation technique. Regarding the promotional effect of DC on bioprocessing, it has been previously shown that its use as immobilisation carrier can lead to increased productivities in alcoholic and lactic acid fermentations (Koutinas et al., 2012; Kourkoutas et al., 2004; Ganatsios et al., 2014). Specifically, in these studies, calculation of the activation energy of alcoholic fermentations at low temperatures showed that it was reduced by an average 42% when cells immobilised on DC were used. Finally, the increased formation of oleic acid and the reduction of saturated HFAs are also of technological importance because they can contribute to the use of the produced SCO as edible oil.

An evolutionary model proposes that the monocluster type ferredoxins have evolved from the dicluster type by deletion of the second cluster and the emergence of a longer α-helix (α2) in order to maintain a stable tertiary fold. Divergent evolution of FdBt and the other monocluster ferredoxins is the likely cause for the presence of the additional loop and the C-terminal extension in FdBt (Fukuyama et al. 1988, 1989). The twofold symmetry axis observed in the dicluster ferredoxins has been lost in the monocluster ferredoxins during evolution (Fig. 3a and c). An alternative evolutionary hypothesis was proposed recently on the basis of the observation that all known ferredoxins from early representatives of different phylogenetic domains contain a single [4Fe–4S] cluster. According to this hypothesis, dicluster ferredoxins have evolved from the monocluster type by the development of a second cluster binding site (Darimont and Sterner, 1994). 3.2.1 The structural basis for ferredoxin thermostability In addition to the ferredoxin structures from two mesophilic (FdDg, FdDa) and one moderately thermophilic organism (FdBt), three ferredoxin structures from hyperthermophilic organisms are available (optimal growth temperature in parenthesis): P. furiosus (100°C), T. litoralis (90°C) and T. maritima (80°C).", "id": 1076, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Pyrococcus furiosus?", "synonym_description": "Pyrococcus furiosus is also known as P. furiosus.

These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5].

Currently, the genus includes 18 species, 17 of which are lipid-dependent. In the speciation of some of these yeasts a process of adaptation to different animal species is clearly detected. For example, Malassezia equina is mainly isolated from horses and Malassezia nana from cats. It should be noted that most species of this genus have been isolated from mammals and only a few of them have been isolated from birds. Concerning the presence of these yeasts, and compared to mammals, far fewer studies have been carried out on birds. It is not surprising, anyway, that two of the last species described, Malassezia brasiliensis and Malassezia psittaci, have been isolated from birds, specifically from pet parrots in Brazil. 2 On the other hand, the vast majority of the species in this genus can grow at 37°C, and very few do so at 40°C. Malassezia cuniculi, a species that rabbits have on their skin, grows better at 37°C and 40°C than at 32°C, the latter being the optimal temperature for the maintenance of Malassezia yeasts. This higher temperature may be explained by the fact that the normal body temperature of rabbits varies between 38.5°C and 40°C. On the contrary, low temperatures are not good for Malassezia yeasts since they lose viability, the reason why it is not recommended to maintain them at room temperature or at 4°C. An exception to this behavior has been found in the last species described in this genus that has been isolated from bats: Malassezia vespertilionis. 3 Most bat species from which this yeast was isolated can hibernate up to 7 months a year (Fig. 1 ). In this state, the animals lower their basal temperature close to the 7–9°C existing in the caves or any other habitat where they hibernate. For this reason, we are not surprised that this new species can grow slowly at 7°C. In fact, its optimal growth temperature is 24°C, lower than that of other Malassezia species.", "id": 1018, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Malassezia vespertilionis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2020962+Malassezia vespertilionis"}

This led to the conclusion that these three groups may represent three distinct new Bartonella species. Candidatus “Bartonella raoultii” (one isolate) has not yet been described, Bartonella mastomydis (21 isolates) has been previously reported [17]. Both were recovered from Mastomys erythroleucus. However, the species we describe here, Bartonella saheliensis (eight isolates) has been recovered from Gerbilliscus gambianus only. Of the validated Bartonella species, the closest to isolate 077 on comparison of the 16S rRNA gene is B. queenslandensis (NR116176) at 99.5%.

We used validated 16S rRNA sequences of Bartonella species to highlight the phylogenetic position of the isolate 077 relative to the others (Fig. 1 ). Strain 077 (Table 1 ) was isolated from G. gambianus blood after 10 days of culture. Subsequently, MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on a Microflex LT spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), as described previously [18].

On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5]. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (65°C) has both archaeol- and caldarchaeol-based lipids, while the mesophilic species of Methanobacterium (37°C) has almost the same core lipid composition. Similarly, some archaea that have caldarchaeol-based (tetraether-type) polar lipids in addition to archaeol-based polar lipids grow above 85°C, and there is one that grows at 20°C. Some archaea have only archaeol-based (diether-type) polar lipids and grow below 40°C, yet there is one that grows at 90°C. The hyperthermophilic Methanopyrus kandleri (90°C [5]) has also only diether-type polar lipids.", "id": 14, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermodesulfobacterium commune?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "1741+Thermodesulfobacterium commune"}

The genome of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 contains 2,992,245 bp on a single circular chromosome and encodes 2,977 proteins and a number of RNAs. The network comprises 718 metabolic and 58 transport/exchange reactions and 705 unique metabolites, based on the annotated genome and available biochemical data. Using the model in conjunction with constraint-based methods, we simulated the metabolic fluxes induced by different environmental and genetic conditions. The predictions were compared to experimental measurements and phenotypes of S. solfataricus. Furthermore, the performance of the network for 35 different carbon sources known for S. solfataricus from the literature was simulated. Comparing the growth on different carbon sources revealed that glycerol is the carbon source with the highest biomass flux per imported carbon atom (75% higher than glucose). Experimental data was also used to fit the model to phenotypic observations. In addition to the commonly known heterotrophic growth of S. solfataricus, the crenarchaeon is also able to grow autotrophically using the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle for bicarbonate fixation. We integrated this pathway into our model and compared bicarbonate fixation with growth on glucose as sole carbon source. Finally, we tested the robustness of the metabolism with respect to gene deletions using the method of Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MOMA), which predicted that 18% of all possible single gene deletions would be lethal for the organism. © 2012 Ulas et al.", "id": 94, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Saccharolobus solfataricus?", "synonym_description": "Saccharolobus solfataricus is also known as Sulfolobus solfataricus or S.solfataricus.

Based on the metal content of their catalytic sites, hydrogenases are classified as either [NiFe], [FeFe], or mononuclear Fe enzymes, and [NiFe] hydrogenases are further categorized into five groups based on the sequences of the catalytic subunits. This chapter describes recombinant engineering strategies, purification procedures, and catalytic properties of two distinct types of [NiFe] hydrogenase from Pyrococcus furiosus, a microorganism with an optimal growth temperature of 100°C. These enzymes are termed soluble hydrogenase I (SHI, group 3) and membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH, group 4). The two hydrogenases were affinity-tagged to facilitate their purification and the purified enzymes have been used for biochemical, mechanistic, and structural analyses. The results have provided us with new insights into how catalysis by SHI is achieved, which could also lead to the development of catalysts for economic hydrogen production, and knowledge of how MBH couples hydrogen gas production to conservation of energy in the form of an ion gradient.

In this work, inactivation kinetics, influencing factors, mechanisms and regrowth of fungal spores in the SODIS process were firstly investigated. The inactivation fitted well with the Geeraerd and Van Impe inactivation model-fitting tool and P. polonicum was more sensitive to simulated sunlight than A. niger. The pH value within the range of 5–9 and low concentration humic acid did not affect the solar inactivation of fungal spores, while HA at the concentration above 5.0 mg/L inhibited the solar inactivation efficiency. Over the tested range, the inactivation efficiency was obtained at the temperature near the optimal growth temperature (30-40 °C for A. niger, 20–30 °C for P. polonicum). According to the results of flow cytometry, ATP concentration and scanning electron microscopy, the solar inactivation of fungal spores was ascribed to endogenous actions. During the SODIS process, the DNA and respiratory chain of fungal spores were attacked. Subsequently, esterase activity was induced. As a result, the spores lost the culturability firstly, accompanied by the exhaustion of ATP, finally the membrane became permeable. Although no fungal spore regrowth was observed in ground water and surface water after SODIS, they remained a certain regrowth potential in nutrient-rich water like R2A.

An interesting feature of SRB is their capacity to perform acetogenic oxidation in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic methanogens, as described in cocultures with Desulfovibrio sp. using lactate and ethanol [3,35]. Furthermore, SRB can reduce oxygen using the same organic substrates applied in the sulfate reduction, such as hydrogen, lactate, alcohols, acetate, and others, and oxidize reduced sulfur compounds to hydrogen sulfide in the aerobic respiration [46]. It was possible to conclude that this population was present in all the nutritional conditions (Fig. 4b) due to its metabolic adaptability. Uncultured eubacterium (AF050594) was previously studied in the evaluation of microbial diversity in an aquifer contaminated with hydrocarbon and chlorinated solvent and undergoing intrinsic bioremediation [47].

These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5]. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (65°C) has both archaeol- and caldarchaeol-based lipids, while the mesophilic species of Methanobacterium (37°C) has almost the same core lipid composition. Similarly, some archaea that have caldarchaeol-based (tetraether-type) polar lipids in addition to archaeol-based polar lipids grow above 85°C, and there is one that grows at 20°C. Some archaea have only archaeol-based (diether-type) polar lipids and grow below 40°C, yet there is one that grows at 90°C.

The electron density at 1.6 Å resolution of the M. barkeri enzyme revealed that four of the five modified amino acid residues of MCR from M. thermoautotrophicum, namely a thiopeptide, an S-methylcysteine, a 1-N-methylhistidine and a 5-methylarginine were also present. Analysis of the environment of the unusual amino acid residues near the active site indicates that some of the modifications may be required for the enzyme to be catalytically effective. In M. thermoautotrophicum and M. kandleri high temperature adaptation is coupled with increasing intracellular concentrations of lyotropic salts.

In this study, the organism was grown in media containing added molybdenum (but not tungsten or vanadium) or added vanadium (but not molybdenum or tungsten). In both cell types, there were no dramatic changes compared with cells grown with tungsten, in the specific activities of hydrogenase, ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductase, or the 2-keto acid ferredoxin oxidoreductases specific for pyruvate, indolepyruvate, 2-ketoglutarate, and 2- ketoisovalerate. Compared with tungsten-grown cells, the specific activities of AOR, FOR, and GAPOR were 40, 74, and 1%, respectively, in molybdenum- grown cells, and 7, 0, and 0%, respectively, in vanadium-grown cells. AOR purified from vanadium-grown cells lacked detectable vanadium, and its tungsten content and specific activity were both ca. 10% of the values for AOR purified from tungsten-grown cells. AOR and FOR purified from molybdenum- grown cells contained no detectable molybdenum, and their tungsten contents and specific activities were >70% of the values for the enzymes purified from tungsten-grown cells. These results indicate that P. furiosus uses exclusively tungsten to synthesize the catalytically active forms of AOR, FOR, and GAPOR, and active molybdenum- or vanadium-containing isoenzymes are not expressed when the cells are grown in the presence of these other metals.", "id": 86, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Pyrococcus furiosus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2261+Pyrococcus furiosus"}

Johnson, personal communication). Members of this genus are moderate thermophiles with temperature optima between 45 and 52°C and demonstrated ability to oxidise iron at temperatures up to 62°C (Johnson et al., 2008; Watling et al., 2008). Thus it may be deduced that temperature was not the defining factor for Sulfobacillus growth in the 55°C tanks, where only one species was detected. However, the pH was sufficiently low, from pH 0.9–1.3, to inhibit iron oxidation by Sulfobacillus species (Watling et al., 2008), with the exception of ‘S. monserratensis’ which has been reported to grow at lower pH than other Sulfobacillus strains (Yahya and Johnson, 2002). The T-RFLP profiles of the 55°C tanks are somewhat similar to those typically seen for moderately thermophilic tank leaching systems, with a community comprising both At. caldus and a Sulfobacillus spp. (e.g. Rawlings, 2007; Foucher et al., 2003; Bryan et al., 2011). The communities in the 55°C tanks lack evidence of L. ferriphilum, which is typically a key component of efficient tank leaching communities. However, efficient bioleaching using a defined culture of At. caldus and S. thermosulfidooxidans has previously been demonstrated at 45°C (Dopson and Lindström, 1999). In the absence of a significant archaeal community, it must be assumed that the efficient mineral oxidation observed in the present system was driven by the simple bacterial community.

Rt8.G4 (optimum growth temperature 68°C), the mesophile Zymomonas mobilis (optimum growth temperature 32°C) and a second, unidentified, soil mesophile designated unid A (optimum growth temperature 27°C). The kinetic behaviour with temperature of each PGK preparation was distinct, despite the conserved nature of the enzyme. The k(cat) values increased with temperature, but not as rapidly exponentially, as might be expected from the Arrhenius equation. Maximum k(cat) values were at much higher temperatures than the optimum growth temperatures for the mesophiles, but for the thermophile the temperature of maximum k(cat) was close to its optimum growth temperature. K(m) values were in general nearly constant through the lower temperature ranges, but increased substantially as the optimum temperature (highest k(cat)) was passed. Thermal irreversible denaturation of the PGK proteins was also investigated by measuring loss of activity over time. In a dilute buffer, Arrhenius plots for denaturation were linear, and the calculated apparent energy of activation (E(act)) for denaturation for the thermophilic PGK was 600 kJ · mol-1, whereas for the mesophilic enzymes the values were 200-250 kJ mol-1.

The degradation of the various cellulosic compounds into simpler sugars by this isolate brands its potential applications in industrial biotechnology. Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Herbivore Achatina fulica Gut fluid Lignocellulose Cellulolytic bacteria Gut 1 Introduction Lignocellulosic (LC) plant biomass is an important renewable carbon resource for the bio-refinery industry, and thus is considered a sustainable and environment friendly alternative to the current petroleum platform (Kamm and Kamm, 2004). The LC biomass is the chief source of natural polysaccharide i.e., cellulose. Lignocellulosic wastes (LCW) can be converted into a worthwhile and effective asset by utilizing microorganisms which can digest the cellulose and result in the production of value added products like biofuels (Lynd et al., 1991), enzymes, and antibiotics (Sun and Cheng, 2003). Unfortunately, most of these wastes are incinerated after harvesting the crop throughout the world (Maki et al., 2012). The bioconversion of LCW into useful sugars has gained more interest during the past decade. Since, the natural way of recycling this waste into useful products seems the most promising and appropriate solution, therefore several governmental and non-governmental organizations have recently come to the front to tackle this problem. The degradation of cellulosic biomass involves a suit of enzymes and cofactors called cellulosome. The cellulosome usually consists of three main cellulases viz., exo-β-1, 4-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.91), endo-β-1, 4-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), and β-1, 4-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) (Wilson and Irwin, 1999). It is the synergy/compatibility of these three enzymes that makes the bioconversion of cellulose polymer to glucose easy and sustainable (Zhang et al., 2017a). The key industrial applications of cellulases include biofuel generation (Da Silva et al., 2005), laundry (Bhat, 2000), organic acids (Piškur et al., 2009) and production of animal feed (Dienes et al., 2004). Being inducible enzymes, secretion of cellulases could be significantly affected by the substrate used for fermentation (Rastogi et al., 2010). Accordingly, low-cost microalgae (Zhang et al., 2017b) and easily accessible agro-wastes, such as grass straw, wheat husk, sugar cane bagasse, etc. could prove desired cellulosic materials for the production of various sugars. Cellulases are widely spread in nature, predominantly produced by microorganisms, including molds, fungi (Zhang et al., 2017c), bacteria and some animals like molluscs, termites etc (Tokuda and Watanabe, 2007; Gascón-Garrido et al., 2013). Microorganisms that are capable to degrade cellulosic compounds are of great importance from biological and ecological point of view. However, most of the fungal cellulases, e.g., Trichoderma cellulase, have shown several drawbacks like, low specific activities, reduced yield, and end-product inhibition (Del Menezzi et al., 2008). Therefore, isolation and characterization of potential microorganisms that can thrive under extreme conditions and hydrolyze agricultural cellulose are of vital importance for industrialization (Gabani et al., 2012). Bacteria are generally considered robust and versatile cellulase producers because of their high growth rate, stability at adverse conditions and presence of multi enzyme complexes. Bacteria are generally preferred over fungi because of their higher recombinant production of enzymes (Maki et al., 2012). However, bacterial cellulases are not studied well as compared to fungal enzymes (Mansour and Salem, 2015). Thus, attempts were made to characterize the crude cellulase of bacterial species.", "id": 1235, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Bacillus tequilensis?", "synonym_description": "Bacillus tequilensis is also known as B. tequilensis.

Cellobiose phosphorylase forms an important cellulose metabolic pathway with an extracellular cellulase system producing cellobiose (9, 10). The reversible catalytic reaction of phosphorylases is one of the most remarkable features that make them suitable catalysts for practical syntheses of oligosaccharides. An oligosaccharide can be produced from inexpensive material by combining reactions of two phosphorylases, one for phosphorolyzing the material and the other for synthesizing the oligosaccharide, in one pot. Based on this idea, LNB is synthesized on a large (kg) scale using sucrose phosphorylase and GalHexNAcP (11). Practical synthesis methods of trehalose and cellobiose have also been developed (12, 13). However, only 14 kinds of substrate specificities have been reported among phosphorylases (13), thus restricting their use. Therefore, it would be useful to find a phosphorylase with novel activity. GalHexNAcP phosphorolyzes GNB and LNB to produce α-d-galactose 1-phosphate (Gal 1-P) and the corresponding N-acetyl-d-hexosamine. To date, GalHexNAcP is the only phosphorylase known to act on β-galactoside. This enzyme was first found in the cell-free extract of Bifidobacterium bifidum (14) and then in B. longum (1, 15), Clostridium perfringens (16), Propionibacterium acnes (17), and Vibrio vulnificus (18). These studies revealed that GalHexNAcPs were classified into three subgroups based on substrate preference between GNB and LNB. These subgroups are as follows: 1) galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (GLNBP), showing similar activity on both GNB and LNB (B. longum and B. bifidum); 2) galacto-N-biose phosphorylase (GNBP), preferring GNB to LNB (C. perfringens and P. acnes); and 3) lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (LNBP), preferring LNB to GNB (V. vulnificus) (18). The ternary structure of GLNBP from B. longum (GLNBPBl) has been revealed recently (19). Based on the similarity in ternary structures between GLNBPBl and β-galactosidase from Thermus thermophilus, which belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 42 (19, 20), GalHexNAcP homologs are classified as GH112 (glycoside hydrolase family 112), although phosphorylases are glycosyltransferases (21, 22).

In the mono-cultures, M. aeruginosa had a poor adaptation for its growth at low temperatures and it grew better at higher temperatures, but C. pyrenoidosa had flexibility for its growth in a wider range of temperatures and it showed the best growth at 25°C. However, high P availability could alleviate the negative effects of low temperatures on M. aeruginosa growth. Meanwhile, algal P utilization behaviors could have a close relationship with their growth patterns at different temperatures, when higher P availability enhanced the growth advantages of two species at the optimal temperature in the mono-cultures. In the co-cultures, the mutually beneficial effects of two algal species for their growth were observed at low temperatures. But at warmer temperatures, the growth of M. aeruginosa was promoted and the growth of C. pyrenoidosa was inhibited when compared to monocultures. The superior P utilization of M. aeruginosa and its allelopathic effects on C. pyrenoidosa could be the main causes. Consistent with the batch experiment in flasks, water temperature in different seasons had a great impact on the growth strategies of algal species, and P enrichment affected algal succession in the natural waters.

Results: Flow cytometry-based benchmarking of a set of GFPs, sfGFPs and species-specific codon-optimized variants revealed that none of the proteins was satisfyingly detectable in P. thermoglucosidasius at its optimal growth temperature of 60 °C. An undirected mutagenesis approach coupled to fluorescence-activated cell sorting allowed the isolation of sfGFP variants that were extremely well expressed in the chassis background at 60 °C. Notably, a few nucleotide substitutions, including silent mutations, significantly improved the functionality and brightness. The best mutant sfGFP(N39D/A179A) showed an 885-fold enhanced mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) at 60 °C and is the most reliable reporter protein with respect to cell-to-cell variation and signal intensity reported so far. The in vitro spectral and thermostability properties were unaltered as compared to the parental sfGFP protein, strongly indicating that the combination of the amino acid exchange and an altered translation or folding speed, or protection from degradation, contribute to the strongly improved in vivo performance. Furthermore, sfGFP(N39D/A179A) and the newly developed cyan and yellow derivatives were successfully used for labeling several industrially relevant thermophilic bacilli, thus proving their broad applicability. Conclusions: This study illustrates the power of in vivo isolation of thermostable proteins to obtain reporters for highly efficient fluorescence labeling. Successful expression in a variety of thermophilic bacteria proved that the novel FPs are highly suitable for imaging and flow cytometry-based studies.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [4119], "text": ["20–25 °C"]}, "context": "In this type of silo, it is easier to maintain anaerobic conditions, which may justify a lower incidence of fungi compared to maize silage, obtained from bunker silos. The fungal species more frequently identified in this work have been previously reported in silage, although important differences were found as a function of location (Alonso et al., 2013). Aspergillus fumigatus has been isolated worldwide from multiple materials, and it is well adapted to silage conditions with an optimum pH of growth close to the pH reached in this fodder. The incidence of this species in silage is very variable ranging from 8 to 75% of samples (Storm et al., 2010a). The hazard associated with this fungus is not only its ability to produce mycotoxins such as GLIO, but also its capacity to cause illness such as allergic reactions, aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis in both animals and farmers (Alonso et al., 2017). In a study on maize silos in Argentina, a high abundance of A. fumigatus was also found (30%), although the most abundant species was A. flavus, which was found in up to 53% of maize silos (González Pereyra et al., 2008). In more temperate regions like France or northern Italy a low incidence of A. flavus has been reported (Garon et al., 2006; Spadaro et al., 2015). In the present study, A. flavus was isolated in 28% of the maize silage samples and 33% of grass silage samples. The presence of this fungus is of special relevance since it can produce AFs, the only mycotoxins regulated in the EU for animal feed. Furthermore, the presence of these mycotoxins in the diet of dairy cows results in carry-over to milk. AFM1 may occur as the main metabolite of AFB1 in animal products such as milk, and it is regulated in many parts of the world due to its toxicity (Ferrero et al., 2019). Penicillium roqueforti sensu stricto (s.s.) and Penicillium paneum are very closely related species, referred to as P. roqueforti sensu lato (s.l.). both well-adapted to silage conditions (low oxygen levels and high lactic acid) (Wambacq et al., 2018). These species produce mycotoxins such as roquefortines, MPA and agroclavine; in addition, P. paneum produces PAT. Studies carried out in Denmark, with a colder climate than in the North of Portugal, reported the presence of these two species in 96% of the silages studied (Storm et al., 2010b). As expected, Fusarium species, commonly present in forage crops in the field, were found in a very low percentage of silage samples (Fig. 1). It has been previously reported their inability to persist in ensiled plant material since they do not survive at the low oxygen and low pH environment of silage (Mansfield and Kuldau, 2007). Other species isolated with a high frequency in our study were D. geotrichum and M. circinelloides although they are not related to mycotoxin production (Driehuis, 2013). The isolation frequency was also studied in relation to the season in which samples were taken, namely fall, winter, and summer. As shown in Fig. 2A, the incidence of A. fumigatus varied among seasons: the lowest percentage of samples contaminated with this fungus was found in winter (54.5%), while the maximum in summer (80%). These data reinforce the hypothesis that the huge differences in the occurrence of A. fumigatus previously found in silage may be caused by climatic variations (Storm et al., 2010a). In fact, it was determined that the most important parameter on the growth rate of this species is temperature, with the faster growth at 37 °C (Alonso et al., 2017). This temperature corresponds to the maximum temperature (average of maximum temperatures 26.7 °C) reached in summer in the region where samples were taken (Fig. S1). On the contrary, climatic variations did not affect the incidence of A. flavus, although the optimal growth temperature for the fungus is 35 °C, which is usually related to the higher isolation frequency of this species in warm climates (Ferrero et al., 2019). In the case of P. paneum and M. circinelloides, the highest isolation frequency was found in fall. Penicillium paneum grows at an optimal temperature of 20–25 °C, but it can germinate in a broad range of both temperature and pH (Santos et al., 2020).", "id": 1061, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Penicillium paneum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "68879+Penicillium paneum"}

Several modifications were introduced to adapt this system for potential use in hESCs. First, the optimal growth temperature for T. fusca is 55°C, and R-loop formation by TfuCascade exhibits a strong temperature dependency (Xiao et al., 2017), which presents a potential technical hurdle for its adoption for mammalian use. Although robust in vivo interference activity was observed at 37°C from T. fusca type I-E CRISPR system functioning inside the E. coli cells (Huo et al., 2014), as a precaution, we screened a number of structure-guided mutations aimed at weakening the thermostability features of TfuCascade using in vitro approaches. TfuCascade bearing an N23A mutation in the Cse2 subunit (Xiao et al., 2017) was found to be more specific in DNA binding and equally efficient in R-loop formation at mesothermic temperature (Figure S1A).

The factors that control their growth and dominance are not clear, including how these multi-species HAB events can persist without competitive exclusion occurring. We compared and contrasted the relative environmental niches of sympatric Chattonella subsalsa and Heterosigma akashiwo isolates from the bays using classic Monod-type experiments. C. subsalsa grew over a temperature range from 10 to 30°C and a salinity range of 5-30 psu, with optimal growth occurring from 20 to 30°C and 15 to 25 psu. H. akashiwo had similar upper temperature and salinity tolerances but also lower limits, with growth occurring from 4 to 30°C and 5 to 30 psu and optimal growth between 16 and 30°C and 10 and 30 psu. These culture results were confirmed by field observations of bloom occurrences in the Inland Bays. Maximum nutrient-saturated growth rates (μmax) for C. subsalsa were ∼0.6 d-1 and half-saturation concentrations for growth (K s) were 9 μM for nitrate, 1.5 μM for ammonium, and 0.8 μM for phosphate. μmax of H. akashiwo (∼0.7 d-1) was slightly higher than C. subsalsa, but Ks values were nearly an order of magnitude lower at 0.3 μM for nitrate, 0.3 μM for ammonium, and 0.2 μM for phosphate. H. akashiwo is able to grow on urea but C. subsalsa cannot, while both can use glutamic acid. Cell yield experiments at environmentally relevant levels suggested an apparent preference by C. subsalsa for ammonium as a nitrogen source, while H. akashiwo produced more biomass on nitrate. Light intensity affected both species similarly, with the same growth responses for each over a range from 100 to 600 μmol photons m-2 s-1.

Assuming that freezing tolerance may play a role in adaptation of L. incisa to specific ecological niches, we examined the capability of L. incisa to tolerate extreme sub-zero temperatures. We report here, that the vegetative cells of L. incisa survived freezing at −20°C and −80°C (over 1 month), without cryoprotective agents or prior treatments. Cells successfully recovered upon thawing and proliferated under optimal growth conditions (25°C). However, cells frozen at −80°C showed better recovery and lower cellular ROS generation upon thawing, compared to those preserved at −20°C. Photosynthetic yield of PSII, estimated by Fv/Fm, temporarily decreased at day 1 post freezing and resumed to the original level at day 3. Interestingly, the thawed algal cultures produced a higher level of chlorophylls, exceeding the control culture. The polar metabolome of the vegetative cells comprised a range of compatible solutes, dominated by glutamate, sucrose, and proline. We posit that the presence of endogenous cryoprotectants, a rigid multilayer cell wall, the high LC-PUFA content in membrane lipids, and putative cold-responsive proteins may contribute to the retention of functionality upon recovery from the frozen state, and therefore for the survival under cryospheric conditions.

Radicle damage and mortality of Q. ilex seeds germinating at 17, 20, 23 and 26°C in Phytophthora cinnamomi, P. gonapodyides, P. quercina and P. psychrophila infested soils were assessed and related to in vitro mycelium growth of the same isolates of the pathogens. The optimum growth temperatures of isolates of P. cinnamomi, P. gonapodyides, P. quercina and P. psychrophila were 20-23, 23-26, 20-23 and 20°C, respectively. At 17 and 20°C, all four Phytophthora species caused 100% acorn mortality, whereas at 26°C, acorn mortality was 100, 10, 25 and 0% in P. cinnamomi, P. gonapodyides, P. quercina and P. psychrophila infested soils, respectively. At 23°C, P. cinnamomi and P. gonapodyides reduced acorn radicle length more than P. quercina and P. psychrophila, whereas at 26°C, only P. cinnamomi caused further reduction in radicle length. The higher susceptibility of germinating acorns in comparison to seedlings reported in the literature indicates age-related susceptibility of Q. ilex to Phytophthora. The seedling/pathogen growth ratio was inversely related to the reduction in radicle length at different temperatures (Radj2 = 0.84, p < 0.0001), suggesting that rapid germination may allow seedlings to escape from infection. Increasing temperatures had different effects on damage to acorns depending on the pathogen present in the soil, indicating that Phytophthora species × temperature interactions determined Q. ilex germination.

It is not clear if they grew on either the aliphatic or the aromatic fraction of oil, or both. Some Paecilomyces strains are resistant to heavy metals, and lead tolerant Paecilomyces species have been used in bioremediation studies for the biosorption of heavy metals (Wise, 1997). Although Paecilomyces spp. are deuteromycetes and do not belong to the group of white-rot fungi, it is worth mentioning that some strains are able to degrade lignin and lignin-related aromatic compounds as well (Kluczek-Turpeinen et al., 2003). A strain of Paecilomyces, isolated from a coastal marine environment and identified at the genus level, was able to grow on n-alkylbenzenes provided that the side chain contained at least four carbons (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). It could not grow on benzene, toluene or ethylbenzene. The transient accumulation and subsequent removal of benzoic and phenyl acetic acids suggests that Paecilomyces strain initially attacked the n-alkyl side chain and also metabolized the aromatic ring (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). The P. variotii strain isolated in our laboratory used toluene as sole carbon and energy source in a mineral medium, with production of carbon dioxide. Our on-going studies indicate that it is unable to metabolize benzene, ethylbenzene or xylenes as single substrates. Toluene was degraded with ammonium as nitrogen source but not with nitrate. No transient accumulation of intermediate products was detected in that strain. Biodegradation of alkylbenzenes does usually start with the hydroxylation of the side chain. Biodegradation of benzene, without any side chain, has not been detected in Paecilomyces strains. Nevertheless, P. lilanicus SBUG-M 1093 was recently shown to partly metabolize biphenyl, a molecule containing two benzene rings without any side-chain, by a first hydroxylation step of one of the benzene rings to form 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybiphenyls (Gesell et al., 2001). Some Paecilomyces strains are thermotolerant and may grow at temperatures above 45–50°C. However, our P. variotii strain could not assimilate toluene at such high temperatures. Either Paecilomyces may grow in the form of pellets or its growth may be characterized by a typical filamentous hyphal aspect (Sinha et al., 2001). It was observed that in Paecilomyces japonica the formation of pellets rather than free mycelia is favoured by high aeration and optimal substrate concentration, as well as mild agitation in aqueous phase (Sinha et al., 2001). Paecilomyces spp. are normally not considered as pathogens and are seldom responsible for human infections, although they may occasionally be involved in mycosis in immunosuppressed patients. 3.5 Cladosporium spp. Although the growth on volatile aliphatic hydrocarbons as n-alkanes by deuteromycetes belonging to the genus Cladosporium was reported several years ago (Siporin and Cooney, 1975; Lindley and Heydeman, 1983, 1986), the isolation and detailed study of strains growing on aromatic pollutants is much more recent. Several years ago, it was mentioned that Cladosporium sphaerospermum ATCC 22711 exhibited a low growth on benzene as well as o- and m-xylenes, although no further information was given (Cofone et al., 1973). More recently, similar results were obtained with C. sphaerospermum ATCC 200384, exhibiting a limited growth on benzene at room temperature between pH 3.5 and 6.5 (Qi et al., 2002). That strain could also grow on toluene and ethylbenzene. No data were reported for the xylene isomers. The levels of biodegradation and/or mineralization were not evaluated in any of those experiments. A few years ago, a strain of C. sphaerospermum was isolated from a gas-phase biofilter treating toluene-polluted air (Weber et al., 1995). When grown in static-liquid medium in presence of about 40μmol toluene, the fungus started degrading the carbon source after a lag phase of about one week. More than 60% of the substrate was recovered as carbon dioxide, while approximatly 30–40% was calculated to be converted to biomass (Prenafeta-Boldú et al., 2001).

Specifically, species isolated from the northern and warmer areas differed from those isolated from the southern and cooler areas. Consistent with the results of this study, temperature is known to be an important factor in the biology of fungi, especially for their growth rate and survival (Desprez-Loustau et al., 2007; Laine, 2008). In the Botryosphaeriaceae, temperature and humidity has also been shown to influence its distribution in Australia (Burgess et al., 2019). Temperature is also known to influence differences in fungal community composition (Coince et al., 2014; Zimmerman and Vitousek, 2012). Moreover, some studies have revealed that historical climate, rather than short-term annual conditions (weather data), influence fungal assemblages along climatic gradients (e.g. Cordier et al., 2012; Giauque and Hawkes, 2016). Understanding the community composition of Botryopshaeriaceae under such different historical temperatures is clearly relevant to understand and predict Botryosphaeriaceae distributions. Maximum historical temperature did not affect Botryosphaeriaceae species richness. This suggests that the number of Botryosphaeriaceae species was similar along the latitudinal gradient sampled. We expected different species richness in northern and warmer areas than in southern and cooler areas.

Similarly, Arnold and Lutzoni (2007) showed that richness of foliar fungal endophytes from a diverse group of plant communities, gradually increase from high latitudes to low latitudes.

Hot‐water treatment for durations of up to 60 min at 50°C failed to reduce the incidence of recovery of seedborne A. niger and A. flavus from seeds incubated at 30°C on agar; A. fumigatus was not recovered from seeds treated in this way. However, when seeds were hot‐water treated at 60°C and incubated on agar at 30°C, A. niger was virtually eliminated by a treatment duration of 15 min or more; the incidence of recovery of A. fumigatus was significantly increased compared with the 50°C treatment and there was no change in the incidence of A. flavus. Hot‐water treatment at 60°C for more than 30 min significantly reduced seed germination. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Instead of using industrial baking strains, we chose reference (Type) strains (Table 2) for this study. F. fructosus (Endo and Okada, 2008) was included as a rather “exotic” candidate. The species depends on fructose for optimal growth, and the main interest for its inclusion was to investigate its carbohydrate metabolism on wheat bran.3.1. Acidity & microbiological status Judged from TTA and organic acid contents (Table 3), the highest acidification was obtained with L. sanfranciscensis, followed by L. plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus. L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii possess anaerobic to microaerophilic properties and have optimal growth temperatures of 37 C. Both strains failed to develop on wheat bran under the applied conditions, the resulting acidity profiles were comparable to those of controls 1 and 2. Due to the requirement of an external electron acceptor for glucose fermentation and the reported inability to ferment maltose (Endo and Okada, 2008; Endo et al., 2014), F. fructosus was not expected to show pronounced growth on wheat bran. However, acid production by F. fructosus was comparable to that of L. brevis. The viable LAB cell counts on MRS agar (þ/ vancomycin) were comparable in all samples.

As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic.

Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions.

In this work, inactivation kinetics, influencing factors, mechanisms and regrowth of fungal spores in the SODIS process were firstly investigated. The inactivation fitted well with the Geeraerd and Van Impe inactivation model-fitting tool and P. polonicum was more sensitive to simulated sunlight than A. niger. The pH value within the range of 5–9 and low concentration humic acid did not affect the solar inactivation of fungal spores, while HA at the concentration above 5.0 mg/L inhibited the solar inactivation efficiency. Over the tested range, the inactivation efficiency was obtained at the temperature near the optimal growth temperature (30-40 °C for A. niger, 20–30 °C for P. polonicum). According to the results of flow cytometry, ATP concentration and scanning electron microscopy, the solar inactivation of fungal spores was ascribed to endogenous actions. During the SODIS process, the DNA and respiratory chain of fungal spores were attacked. Subsequently, esterase activity was induced. As a result, the spores lost the culturability firstly, accompanied by the exhaustion of ATP, finally the membrane became permeable. Although no fungal spore regrowth was observed in ground water and surface water after SODIS, they remained a certain regrowth potential in nutrient-rich water like R2A.

An evolutionary model proposes that the monocluster type ferredoxins have evolved from the dicluster type by deletion of the second cluster and the emergence of a longer α-helix (α2) in order to maintain a stable tertiary fold. Divergent evolution of FdBt and the other monocluster ferredoxins is the likely cause for the presence of the additional loop and the C-terminal extension in FdBt (Fukuyama et al. 1988, 1989). The twofold symmetry axis observed in the dicluster ferredoxins has been lost in the monocluster ferredoxins during evolution (Fig. 3a and c). An alternative evolutionary hypothesis was proposed recently on the basis of the observation that all known ferredoxins from early representatives of different phylogenetic domains contain a single [4Fe–4S] cluster. According to this hypothesis, dicluster ferredoxins have evolved from the monocluster type by the development of a second cluster binding site (Darimont and Sterner, 1994). 3.2.1 The structural basis for ferredoxin thermostability In addition to the ferredoxin structures from two mesophilic (FdDg, FdDa) and one moderately thermophilic organism (FdBt), three ferredoxin structures from hyperthermophilic organisms are available (optimal growth temperature in parenthesis): P. furiosus (100°C), T. litoralis (90°C) and T. maritima (80°C).", "id": 1077, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermotoga maritima?", "synonym_description": "Thermotoga maritima is also known as T. maritima.

While it shares the environment with iron- and sulfur-oxidising acidophiles, it does not contribute directly to copper extraction from sulfide minerals. Keywords Bioleaching Ferrous ion oxidation Organic reagents Sulfobacillus Acidiphilium Acidithiobacillus 1 Introduction Heap leaching of copper oxides and secondary copper sulfides is responsible for about 20% of world copper production. Copper is recovered from oxide minerals using a dilute sulfuric acid solution. Sulfide mineral dissolution requires the presence of an oxidant, such as ferric ion, in the acidic solution and is assisted by the presence of acidophilic bacteria and archaea that utilise sulfide minerals as an energy source. About 20 heap bioleaching operations have been commissioned since 1980, initially in Chile but more recently in the Asia-Pacific region (Watling, 2006). In many cases the copper is purified and recovered from solution using solvent extraction and electrowinning technologies. These successful operations demonstrate the robust nature and operational simplicity of mining biotechnology, together with health, safety and environmental benefits, and capital and operating cost advantages. Process waters from heap leach – solvent extraction – electrowinning operations typically contain moderate concentrations of dissolved organic compounds. Some organic compounds become entrained in the aqueous solution during passage of the leach solution through the solvent extraction plant. Bioleaching acidophiles are generally sensitive to organic matter in their environments but the effects of solvent extraction reagents on bacterial growth have not been widely reported, possibly because early results indicated that At. ferrooxidans was not greatly affected by them. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is the most studied of the bioleaching acidophiles and was for many years thought to be the most important contributor to enhanced bioleaching, largely because it flourished in laboratory cultures. It grows well in the pH range 1.8–2.5 and temperature range 30–35 °C with an upper limit at about 40 °C, is tolerant of high base metal concentrations in its environment and oxidises both iron(II) and reduced sulfur compounds to iron(III) and sulfate, respectively (Rawlings, 1997).", "id": 751, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Acidiphilium cryptum?", "synonym_description": "Acidiphilium cryptum is also known as A. cryptum.

The recombinant PCSI was expressed in E. coli with a six-histidine tag at its C-terminus. Most endogenous E. coli proteins were eliminated in the crude extract and the recombinant PCSI was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the PCSI protein was purified to apparent homogeneity with a molecular mass of about 69kDa (Fig. 5 ), which was in good agreement with the expected molecular mass of 68,751.93Da (Table 1).

F. pennivorans (61.52 %), F, nodosum (9.28 %), and Caldicellulosiruptor unclassified (7.27 %) were the top 3 in TAT-4. These results were compared with the original study that generated and analyzed the samples from Tattapani hot springs [52]. The similarity indicated that the data generated by MiDSystem are reliable. The species found to be most abundant among the four samples were the thermophiles. Owing to the application of different approaches, i.e. shotgun sequencing versus 16S technology, the species abundance percentage or the rankings might show slight variations between the two studies. Although the most abundant phyla were different from the original paper, Proteobacteria, Deinococcus Thermus, and Thermotogae were still found to be abundant in all four samples. At the genus level, the result was the same for TAT-1 in that Acinetobacter had the highest abundance. Pyrobaculum aerophilum, an archaeal species, was also abundant; it grows optimally at 100 °C and at pH 7.0 [53], closely matching the temperature and pH value of TAT-1. Similar to the original article, F. nodosum was observed to be abundant in the three samples under 70 °C (Supplementary Figure S2B-D).", "id": 1059, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermus igniterrae?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "88189+Thermus igniterrae"}

Nevertheless, these wild-type thermoactive enzymes have relatively low catalytic efficiency (k cat /k m ) and isomerization rate that limit their commercial use. Briefly for industrial application, a GI should have relatively acidic pH optimum, an elevated optimal temperature and a higher affinity for glucose [5]. In the continuing search for a novel glucose isomerase with suitable properties for 55-HFCS production, we studied a GI from the thermophilic anaerobic Caldicoprobacter algerensis.

The PCR primers used were: Q6AQBONcoI (5′-CATGCCATGGATAATTTATCGTTCAGACCAAAATTGTACC-3′) and Q6AQBOHindIII (5′-AAAAGCTTTTAGCTGAGTTTATTATATTTTTGCTGTAACC-3′). The restriction sites NcoI and HindIII (underlined) were included to facilitate subcloning. The amplified 0.5 kb product was subcloned following standard procedures into the pET24d(+) vector and the resultant plasmid, pET24-DpNDT was used to transform competent E. coli DH5α cells. After confirming the correctness of the Dpndt sequence, this vector was then used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein overproduction. As a result of the cloning strategy the final sequence of the recombinant DpNDT protein herein studied differs from the original one (UniprotKB: Q6AQB0) in that it lacks the first five amino acid residues and Asn7 is replaced with Asp7. Numbering of the DpNDT sequence used in this work refers to the complete sequence. The efpdt gene construct for EfPDT used in crystallization assays was amplified from genomic DNA from Enterocococus faecalis V583. The PCR primers for the construct were 5′-TACTTCCAATCCAATGCCATGACAAAAATTTATTTTGCAGGACCTTTATTTTCG-3′ forward and 5′-TTATCCACTTCCAATGTTATGACAATCGTTGCTTAATTTCTTCCAACA AATC-3′reverse.

To gain more information about the bases of SpAAPhis promiscuity, we determined the kinetic parameters for the enzyme on all substrates that gave reasonable activities (Table 2 ). Determined Km values were very similar for all substrates whereas marked differences were observed as for kcat . Interestingly, the enzyme was more active on ONpC4, despite a slightly higher affinity for N-acyl-amino acids. In this respect, SpAAP is similar to other enzymes that evolved for one activity but retained very high efficiency on secondary reactions as well [43]. SpAAPhis was tested for activity in presence of several metal ions to check for inhibitors and substrate-specific effects (Fig. 7 ). Only 1 mM Cu2+ inactivated the enzyme, in agreement with Cu2+ and other heavy metal ions (e.g. zinc, cadmium, divalent copper, manganese) inhibition already report for AAPs from Arabidopsis thaliana, Cucumis sativus, Rattus norvegicus [44] and other enzymes belonging to the POPs family. Moreover, changes were moderate on both ester and amide substrates, suggesting no metal ion is involved in the catalytic mechanism. Catalysis involves weak interactions between enzyme and substrate. It is reported that in some cases the native and promiscuous substrates interact with the enzyme using different type of chemical interactions that are differently influenced by temperature [12,13]. To understand if AAPA and esterolytic activities are equally affected by temperature, we measured the activity optimum of SpAAPhis on both NAcLeupNA and ONpC4 substrates (best substrate for the primary and secondary activity, respectively) (Fig. 8 ).

These values, all below the recommended DNA–DNA hybridization threshold value (<70%), suggest that V. doumboii strain Marseille-Q1616T is different from the compared species. In addition, the degree of genomic similarity of strain Marseille-Q1616T with related species was estimated using the Orthologous Average Nucleotide Identity Tool (OAT) software [15]. Genomic analyses showed OrthoANI values ranging from 69.11% between V. doumboii and V. pantothenticus to 80.63%, between V. pantothenticus and V. dokdonensis. Additionally, 70.64% was the highest OrthoANI value shared by V. doumboii and V. halodenitrificans (Fig. 3 ). Given that all the estimates of genomic similarity were below the 95% threshold delimiting new species, we confirm that V. doumboii, is a new species within the Virgibacillus genus. Conclusion Phenotypic, biochemical, phylogenetic and genomic evidence show that strain Marseille-Q1616T is different from its phylogenetic relatives and therefore represents a new species, within the Virgibacillus genus, for which we suggest the name Virgibacillus doumboii.

SB155-2. In order to understand the evolutionary relationship of NosZ and its accessary proteins, phylogenetic analyses were performed based on each gene within nos gene cluster. The strains belonging to the genera Nitratiruptor and Sulfurovum were respectively clustered according to their genus (Figure S10). Mesophilic Sulfurimonas autotrophica was often placed in the outermost Campylobacteria from deep-sea hydrothermal environments, which is contrary to its phylogenetic position inferred by genome sequences (Figure S7). The tree topologies were relatively conserved among all genes with the exception of nosC1, whose topology was consistent with both genome- and 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny. Discussion Physiological and Genomic Characteristics of Strain HRV44T The physiological characteristics of strain HRV44T indicated that the strain is a facultatively anaerobic chemolithoautotroph. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicated that strain HRV44T was most closely related to Nitratiruptor sp. EPR55-1, although its physiological characteristics were more similar to that of Nitratiruptor tergarcus. Although it was difficult to determine whether strain HRV44T belongs to the genus Nitratiruptor based solely on 16S rRNA gene sequences, combination of AAI and genome-based phylogeny suggested that strain HRV44T represents a novel species of the genus Nitratiruptor. Strain HRV44T showed a relatively narrow growth range when compared with phylogenetically related campylobacterial strains, implying a limited niche of strain HRV44T. The strain consumed N2O more than three times as fast as the mesophilic N2O-reducing campylobacteria (Mino et al., 2018). Although previous studies evaluated microbial N2O reduction under pH above 7.0 because low pH potentially inhibits NosZ activities in some bacterial species (Bergaust et al., 2012a; Domeignoz-Horta et al., 2016), strain HRV44T showed high N2O-reducing activity at around pH 6.0.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "However, E. histolytica in the dog rarely encysts, and trophic amebae in dog stools are not infective (Barr, 1998; Eyles et al., 1954). In the mammalian host, ingested cysts germinate in the small intestine and are carried to the colon, where the amebae attack the epithelial lining. Cysteine proteases are probably a virulence determinant of the amebae (Bruchhaus et al., 2003). In cases of dysentery with accompanying diarrhea, numerous trophic amebae, often containing ingested red blood cells, are found in the unformed or loose stool. In asymptomatic cases, the formed stool contains cysts whose development parallels the removal of water from the stool as it passes to the rectal area. Trophic amebae in unformed stools do not encyst, nor are they infective to others. The cyst, by virtue of its protective wall, is the prime infective stage in the ameba life-cycle. The presence of non-pathogenic commensals in the gut seen upon examination of stool samples can lead to erroneous laboratory diagnoses. Cysts of Entamoeba can remain viable for 2–4 weeks outside of the host provided they are in a moist or wet environment. Desiccation and extreme temperatures can render cysts non-viable. Amebic dysentery is primarily a disease of tropical or sub-tropical areas of the world, where climatic conditions favor cyst survival and sewage is apt to contaminate the drinking water supply. But sporadic outbreaks of the disease have occurred throughout the world, regardless of temperatures, and one such textbook example occurred in Chicago during the 1933 World's Fair with over 1000 cases (Albach and Booden, 1978). In addition to humans, E. histolytica is found in a large number of non-human primates and, less often, in dogs (Barr, 1998; Eyles et al., 1954). Another species, E. polecki, found in pigs has been reported from humans but is not highly infective for humans (Levine, 1961). E. moshkovskii, an ameba morphologically similar to E. histolytica but non-pathogenic, has been isolated from sewage in several parts of the world and, recently, has been reported in 21% of Bangladeshi children sampled as a non-invasive commensal (Ali et al., 2003).

Despite this light limitation, higher temperatures still resulted in faster growth up to the respective optima, reflecting increased efficiency in energy supply and/or utilisation as well as biomass synthesis for cell division. In the PNSB Rhodospirillum rubrum, both photosynthetic electron transport and respiration are enhanced, conforming to Arrhenius kinetics, up to 41 °C [48]. The photosynthetic reaction centres are highly conserved amongst PNSB, and this degree of thermostability could facilitate more effective use of available light for energy production and thus faster growth at higher temperatures, as demonstrated here. Increased temperatures supported higher hydrogen production rates The ability to endure higher temperatures has significant consequences for the catalytic efficiency of all cellular pathways, as demonstrated by increased biomass synthesis.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "In this regard, Kumar et al. (2019) have isolated Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis ERDD5:01 from the glacial stream of East Rathong Glacier in Himalaya. The bacteria revealed survivability against environmental stress like UV radiations, constant freeze-thaw cycles and freezing temperature. Two necessary AAA+ proteases that encode ATP-dependent chaperone ClpB and glycine betaine/l-proline ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter ATP-binding protein genes, have been identified in the bacterial genome. The bacteria maintain their osmotic stability via proliferating of various compatible solutes, such as choline and glycine betaine, which are primary organic solutes stored by cryophiles in reaction to osmotic stress. 4.8 Membrane proteases The role of membrane proteins in the bacterial cells are different, however for environmental isolates, membrane proteins are responsible for cell-to-cell communication, quorum sensing, nutrient uptake, substrate addition, and leftover exudation. These roles make the enzymes vital for the growth of bacterial strains in a specific ecological conditions (Cao and Bazemore-Walker, 2014). The study of bacterial membrane proteins is challenging due to their low solubility and abundance compared to cytoplasmic proteins. Also, isolation and purification of membrane proteins without cytoplasmic impurity are demanding process (Solis and Cordwell, 2011). One of the critical membrane proteases is FtsH, a cytoplasmic-membrane protease with the main function at cell division in several Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus and B. subtilis (Lin et al., 2014). Ronholm et al. (2015) showed the importance of FtsH in cell division of Planococcus halocryophilus isolated from permafrost soil layer of Canadian Arctic regions. Psychrotrophic bacteria contain various of membrane proteases like protease family BA0301 or membrane-associated zinc metalloprotease separated from Chryseobacterium strain IHBB 10212 isolated from glacier soil of Indian trans-Himalayas (Pal et al., 2017). 5 Production of proteases Given the significance of proteases in food industries, researches in this field have attempted to economically produce the enzymes through bacterial sources. Therefore, due to the growing utilization of proteases, the need to invent new microbial strains owning suitable features and improve low-cost and industrial media formulations has been considered increasingly (Annamalai et al., 2013). The final price of enzymes is one of the most important factors affecting the limitation of their various uses. Higher costs are related to the production and purification of the enzymes from the culture medium and other preparation processes. Different substrates are used for protease production such as peptone, skim milk, casein or milk. Beside, some animal, plant or agricultural wastes are used as substrates, due to high protein content, free accessibility and low price (Saranraj and Naidu, 2014). Numerous isolation methods have been debated in research to screen and identify strains for industrial goals. Furthermore, recombinant DNA technology could be applied in strains’ enhancement to expand their productivity to an industrial scale. The various environmental and nutritional factors influencing the production of proteases by psychrotrophic strains are discussed in the following sections. Different stages of the psychrotrophic proteases engineering for industrial applications are depicted in Fig. 3 . 5.1 Culture medium All bacterial strains have their optimal growth conditions for physiological activities and duplication. The bacterial culture medium supplies nitrogen and carbon source and desirable pH conditions for bacterial growth. Cultures such as nutrient agar and broth, trypticase soy agar, milk or skim milk agar, marine agar and in some cases other specific mediums are used for the isolation of bacterial strains. For this reason, the bacterial growth rate and production of an enzyme can reach an optimum value in a specialized medium (Yang et al., 2018). Salwan et al. (2020) diluted the soil samples of Western Himalayas up to ten-fold in sterilized distilled cold water and spread them on trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar plates. They then incubated plates at 5 °C for 7–14 days and 28 °C for 2–3 days. The purified bacterial isolates were spot inoculated on skim milk agar plates and incubated at 5 °C for 7 days and 28 °C for 3 days. Based on clear zone formation at 5 °C, 55 isolates selected as protease-producing psychrotrophic strains, and the conducted molecular tests indicated that the isolates were belonged to Pseudomonas, Planomicrobium, Exiguobacterium, Serratia, and Paenibacillus. About 11 isolates showed growth in a medium having up to 0.5% NaCl, 8 isolates up to 2.5% NaCl, 2 isolates up to 5% NaCl and 1 isolate up to 7% NaCl.", "id": 1087, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "104087+Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis"}

At 85°C, T. guaymasensis exhibited a barophilic response at 20 and 35 MPa but inhibition of growth occurred at 50 MPa; at 50 MPa, cell replication was repressed, the mean cell size increased, and production of starch-hydrolysing enzymes was significantly stimulated. Barophily was also expressed by T. guaymasensis under 20 MPa at sub-optimal temperature (70°C) but morphological alterations of cells were observed earlier (35 MPa). No barophily was exhibited by T. aggregans at 85°C. In this case, cell replication was repressed at 20 MPa and remarkable inhibition of growth occurred at 50 MPa.

The number of isolations of recently-described species from lymph nodes, among them Mycobacterium lentiflavum [19] and Mycobacterium bohemicum [20], is steadily increasing as well as frequently reported. A very peculiar kind of lymphadenitis, affecting both superficial and deep lymph nodes, develops in immunocompromised patients, particularly during immune system restoration that follows treatment with HAART. The disease, known as inmmunoreconstitution syndrome [21], is a paradoxical reaction of the lymphatic system to a pre-existing, undiagnosed mycobacterial infection. Cutis and Soft Tissues Infections NTM infections of cutis and soft tissues (hand, elbow, knee and foot being the main sites) are characterized by granulomatous lesions developing a few weeks after infection. Satellite lymph nodes also may be affected and evolution to ulceration and cellulitis, and even to cutaneous dissemination, is not rare. The most common sources include contact with contaminated water or infected fish, traumas and surgical wounds. The cutaneous infection caused by Mycobacterium marinum, which mostly affects those who own aquariums and other people in contact with fish, is the best known. The lesion, usually at the hand or the forearm, is initially nodular but may subsequently ulcerate; the sporotrychoid form is characterized by small nodules along lymphatic ducts [22]. Spontaneous healing of the lesion is very rare.

ISAKSEN und 10RGENSEN (1996) have de­scribed typical correlations between growth yield and temperature for two marine strains of SRB. With the psy­chrotrophic Desulforhopalus vacuolatus they obtained nearly constant growth yields in the temperature range from 0 °C to 15°C, while a mesophilic strain, resembling Desulfobacter curvatus, showed strongly decreasing growth yields at temperatures below 10°C. Since the growth yield to temperature correlations of our isolates are more corresponding to those of the later strain than to Desulforhopalus vacuolatus, we define our isolates as psychrotolerant mesophilic bacteria. Nevertheless, from their ability to grow well throughout the whole tempera­ture range found in their habitat it is likely that they play an important role in the anaerobic mineralization of or­ganic matter in Lake Stechlin littoral sediments. On basis of 16S rRNA analysis strains STU, STL4 and STL6 are clearly members of the genus Desulfovib­rio, although they show marked differences to the other known species of this genus. Due to this separated posi­tions in the phylogenetic tree of sulfate-reducing bacteria their assignment to new species is undoubted. While the strains STLI and STL4 belong to the same species, which is assigned as Desulfovibrio cuneatus, strain STL6 ex­hibits only 90.3 % sequence similarity to this new species. After the definition of the species level on the basis of DNA relatedness (JOHNSON, 1984) and its adaptation to 16S rRNA sequence similarity (DEVEREUX et al., 1990) strain STL6 should be assigned to a new species of its own, Desulfovibrio litoralis.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "4 Discussion Our results provide evidence that the nuisance alga G. semen, has significantly increased in its occurrence and abundance in Swedish lakes since 1988. Indeed, it was present in more than a quarter of the lakes included in the Swedish national monitoring program during 1997–2002. We found that Gonyostomum spread to more lakes and increased in occurrence and biomass within lakes during the two decades analyzed. Our analyses identified increased surface water temperatures as a potential driver of this expansion. We suggest that this effect is coupled to an extended growth period, which is indicated by their growth and cyst germination temperature windows. Determining the factors that explain distribution and expansion of phytoplanktonic species is very challenging. Most species tolerate a range of temperature, pH, and nutrient levels, and although factors that regulate biomass are well-known, predictions are difficult. To untangle the factors that were favorable for Gonyostomum growth from those causing its expansion, we performed both a spatial and temporal study. Like previous studies (Cronberg et al., 1988; Lepistö et al., 1994) on Gonyostomum's expansion during the 1970s and 1980s, we identified high water color, moderate nutrient levels, and low pH as significant characteristics of Gonyostomum lakes. These results simply show where Gonyostomum is found most often, but do not explain its expansion. In contrast, our temporal analyses based on monthly samples in 13 lakes during 20 years showed that the variables that best explained the observed increase in Gonyostomum biomass and expansion to new lakes were increases in surface water temperature and the intensity of thermal stratification. First of all, the seasonal Mann–Kendall test showed a significant trend of increasing Gonyostomum occurrence along with a significant increase in temperature. Second, no samples with a water temperature below 6°C contained Gonyostomum. The PLS analysis of a single lake (Rotehogstjärnan) showed that temperature was an important factor, and last, but not least, the laboratory studies showed that positive growth was not observed below 6°C.", "id": 1326, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Gonyostomum semen?", "synonym_description": "Gonyostomum semen is also known as G. semen.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Penicillium roqueforti sensu stricto (s.s.) and Penicillium paneum are very closely related species, referred to as P. roqueforti sensu lato (s.l.). both well-adapted to silage conditions (low oxygen levels and high lactic acid) (Wambacq et al., 2018). These species produce mycotoxins such as roquefortines, MPA and agroclavine; in addition, P. paneum produces PAT. Studies carried out in Denmark, with a colder climate than in the North of Portugal, reported the presence of these two species in 96% of the silages studied (Storm et al., 2010b). As expected, Fusarium species, commonly present in forage crops in the field, were found in a very low percentage of silage samples (Fig. 1). It has been previously reported their inability to persist in ensiled plant material since they do not survive at the low oxygen and low pH environment of silage (Mansfield and Kuldau, 2007). Other species isolated with a high frequency in our study were D. geotrichum and M. circinelloides although they are not related to mycotoxin production (Driehuis, 2013). The isolation frequency was also studied in relation to the season in which samples were taken, namely fall, winter, and summer. As shown in Fig. 2A, the incidence of A. fumigatus varied among seasons: the lowest percentage of samples contaminated with this fungus was found in winter (54.5%), while the maximum in summer (80%). These data reinforce the hypothesis that the huge differences in the occurrence of A. fumigatus previously found in silage may be caused by climatic variations (Storm et al., 2010a). In fact, it was determined that the most important parameter on the growth rate of this species is temperature, with the faster growth at 37 °C (Alonso et al., 2017).", "id": 854, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Penicillium roqueforti?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "5082+Penicillium roqueforti"}

Four races (T1, T2, T3, T4) are described for the four Xanthomonas species (Jones et al., 2005). In Florida, Xp is the only species associated with BST and is comprised of two races, T3 and T4 (Stall et al., 2009). Several states in the southeastern U.S., particularly Georgia and Florida, are major suppliers of tomato transplant seedlings for fresh tomato production in the northeast and central U.S. (Gitaitis et al., 1992). Until the 1990's, tomato seedlings for fresh tomato production were produced directly in the field (Gitaitis et al., 1992). However, BST outbreaks in transplant fields along with other foliar fungal diseases and the introduction of mechanized planting required a shift to greenhouse-grown seedlings (Gitaitis et al., 1992). Contaminated seed is an important source of BST infestation during tomato seedling production (Potnis et al., 2015). Currently, tomato transplant seedlings are produced in greenhouses, modified high tunnels or other protected structures. Environmental conditions within these structures favor BST epidemics, due to frequent overhead watering, high humidity and high plant densities (Potnis et al., 2015). Optimal conditions for BST outbreaks in tomato transplant operations occur when temperatures range from 25 to 28 °C coupled with overhead irrigation (Obradovic et al., 2008).", "id": 472, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Xanthomonas vesicatoria?", "synonym_description": "Xanthomonas vesicatoria is also known as X. vesicatoria.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Another example is cellobiose phosphorylase from Cellvibrio gilvus, which is a cellulolytic bacterium. Cellobiose phosphorylase forms an important cellulose metabolic pathway with an extracellular cellulase system producing cellobiose (9, 10). The reversible catalytic reaction of phosphorylases is one of the most remarkable features that make them suitable catalysts for practical syntheses of oligosaccharides. An oligosaccharide can be produced from inexpensive material by combining reactions of two phosphorylases, one for phosphorolyzing the material and the other for synthesizing the oligosaccharide, in one pot. Based on this idea, LNB is synthesized on a large (kg) scale using sucrose phosphorylase and GalHexNAcP (11). Practical synthesis methods of trehalose and cellobiose have also been developed (12, 13). However, only 14 kinds of substrate specificities have been reported among phosphorylases (13), thus restricting their use. Therefore, it would be useful to find a phosphorylase with novel activity. GalHexNAcP phosphorolyzes GNB and LNB to produce α-d-galactose 1-phosphate (Gal 1-P) and the corresponding N-acetyl-d-hexosamine. To date, GalHexNAcP is the only phosphorylase known to act on β-galactoside. This enzyme was first found in the cell-free extract of Bifidobacterium bifidum (14) and then in B. longum (1, 15), Clostridium perfringens (16), Propionibacterium acnes (17), and Vibrio vulnificus (18). These studies revealed that GalHexNAcPs were classified into three subgroups based on substrate preference between GNB and LNB. These subgroups are as follows: 1) galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (GLNBP), showing similar activity on both GNB and LNB (B. longum and B. bifidum); 2) galacto-N-biose phosphorylase (GNBP), preferring GNB to LNB (C. perfringens and P. acnes); and 3) lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (LNBP), preferring LNB to GNB (V. vulnificus) (18). The ternary structure of GLNBP from B. longum (GLNBPBl) has been revealed recently (19). Based on the similarity in ternary structures between GLNBPBl and β-galactosidase from Thermus thermophilus, which belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 42 (19, 20), GalHexNAcP homologs are classified as GH112 (glycoside hydrolase family 112), although phosphorylases are glycosyltransferases (21, 22).

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Moreover Chlamydomonas applanata did not show growth in acidic condition and exhibited maximum growth at pH 7.4 [46]. Low pH condition limits the nutrient uptake which leads to the reduction of photosynthetic ability thereby decreasing the accumulation of total carbon and evolution of oxygen [47]. Acidic conditions also induce metal toxicity which in turn affects the growth and development of various algae including Chlamydomonas acidophila and Chlorella species [19]. In acidic conditions (pH4.4) hydrogen ions denature certain proteolytic enzymes such as V-lysin which facilitates releasing of daughter cells from within the parental wall [19,48]. Similarly C. vulgaris exhibits growth in extreme acidic environments such as pH of 3.0 with altered biochemical modifications [49]. The energy required to maintain internal pH in these acid-tolerant algae is conserved and maintained through cellular metabolism. This is one of the reason that algal growth is not drastically affected under acidic conditions [50]. Dunaliella acidophila adapts to low pH conditions in growth media by accumulating glycerol to prevent the osmotic imbalance [51]. In extent certain algal species accumulate more saturated fatty acids and storage lipids such as triacylglycerides (TG) to tolerate acidic conditions [52]. Similarly at pH 8.0, C. minutum displayed moderate growth and produced more H2 when compared to C. reinhardtii (Fig. 5). Guan et al. [53] reported that optimal hydrogen was produced at pH 8.0 in Platymonas subcordiformis. Alkaline conditions also limit the availability of nutrients, specifically carbon from CO2 and suppresses the process of photosynthesis [43,54]. On the other hand in higher pH, carbon is available in the form of bicarbonates. Hence affinity of algae towards free CO2 decreases under high pH conditions [54,55]. Alkaline condition also modifies the plasma membrane moiety that suppresses the algal growth. Moreover alkaline pH prevents the rupture of cell wall of mother cells and inhibits autospore release, thus prolongs the time for cell cycle completion [19,56]. Overall this data concludes that both pH 6.0 and 8.0 are also favorable for growth as well for H2 production apart from productive neutral pH condition in C. minutum. Effect of temperature on hydrogen production in C. minutum Generally optimum temperature range observed was between 20 and 40 °C for growth of different algal species based on the literature with some exceptions.", "id": 949, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Chlamydomonas applanata?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "35704+Chlamydomonas applanata"}

These strains were subcultured in sterile M17 or De Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broth at their optimum growth temperature (37 or 42 °C) overnight. 2.2 Screening of EPS producing LAB strains for removal of cholesterol EPS producing LAB strains containing cholesterol removal ability was evaluated in vitro by the method of Tok and Aslim (2010). LAB strains were inoculated at the rate of 1% (w/v) into MRS broth containing bile salt (3 mg/ml) and water-soluble cholesterol (100 µg/ml) followed by incubation at optimum growth temperature of the strains for 12 h. The cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 1 °C and the spent broth was collected for the cholesterol assay. The culture uninoculated MRS broth was used as control. Cholesterol removal by the strains was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the differences in optical density at 517 nm (Abd El Ghany et al., 2016) and calculated using the following formula: Cholesterol removal ( % ) = Absorbance control − Absorbance spent broth Absorbance control × 100 Based on the preliminary screening, the EPS producing L. fermentum NCDC400 (LFNCDC400) exhibiting the highest cholesterol removal ability and was selected for further studies. 2.3 Production, extraction and purificationof EPS from LFNCDC400 EPS was produced in de-proteinized whey medium according to the method suggested by Behare, Singh, Nagpal, and Rao (2013). The supernatant was collected and precipitated by repetitive ethanol extraction (Van Geel-Schutten et al., 1999). The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min and lyophilized, yielding the crude EPS. The freeze-dried crude EPS, derived from LFNCDC400, was dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and fractionated by an anion exchange chromatography on the DEAE-A50 column with increasing gradient of NaCl (0.1 M, 0.25 M, 0.5 M, and 1 M) solution.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "For example, Flammulina velutipes, P. eryngii and P. ostreatus developed spawn-burning above 30°C, 34°C and 35°C, respectively. Spawn-burning has become the most serious problem for edible mushroom cultivated with bags in summer. It was thought that spawn-burning was caused by environmental high temperatures that directly damaged mycelia resulting in mycelial death. However, the mycelial metabolic activity increased the temperature of bags. It has been suggested that strain selection for resistance to high temperature might results in tolerance to spawn-burning. However, the mechanism of spawn-burning remained unclear. In this study, our results showed that the maximum growth temperature (38°C) and lethal temperature (41°C) of P. eryngii was far higher than spawn-burning temperature (34°C). Therefore, some other factors must be involved in spawn-burning. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of spawn-burning syndrome in P. eryngii growing in edible mushroom cultivation bags. On the one hand increased aerobic respiration of mycelia at high temperatures consumes more oxygen compared to medium temperatures (Pietikäinen et al., 2005; Prasad et al., 1979); on the other hand the oxygen solubility in water decreased at high temperatures. One possibility is that spawn-burning symptoms could be due to decreased dissolved oxygen content in the substrate at high temperature since the plastic bags film limits oxygen supply. If the level of oxygen in the substrate becomes inadequate, then the lack of oxygen and accumulation of carbon dioxide to the mycelia could result in spawn-burning. To test this hypothesis, analysis was done under spawn-burning conditions for the levels of the fermentation enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, EC 4.1.1.1), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27), the levels of the fermentation products ethanol, acetaldehyde and lactate, and the impact of these fermentation products on mycelial growth. The results showed that anaerobic respiration in cultivation substrate of mycelia was involved in spawn-burning. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Strain P. eryngii strain ACCC 52626, provided by the Agricultural Culture Collection of China (ACCC), was used in this study.

In addition, R. palustris LinB was a cytosolic protein without a signal peptide shown by the annotation. From Fig. 1, a positive correlation between cell number activity and the degradation of HBCD was observed, Since LinB was the possible degrading enzyme of HBCD in R. palustris, the cytosolic nature rendering its activity could be restricted in living cell. The reports on previous studies have exemplified that no further degradation reaction occurred once PBCDE was formed. Therefore, it was suggested that either inhibiting the expression of LinA or deleting LinA related genes in YSC3 cells might ensure the complete degradation and mineralization of HBCD, which emphasized the safer usage of cells in HBCD contaminated sites. Based on overall studies, it was proposed that HBCD was sequentially debrominated via a series of dibromoelimination steps as a major pathway for the degradation of HBCD in the environment. 4 Conclusion The main focus of this study was the screening of pure culture cells with a noticeable HBCD degradation characteristic. Various Rhodopseudomonas palustris strains possessed good HBCD biodegradation capability. R. palustris YSC3, the best one, can effectively degrade HBCD aerobically.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "For example, thermophilic Campylobacteria such as Hydrogenimonas thermophila, Nautilia profundicola, Caminibacter mediatlanticus, (Voordeckers et al., 2005), Cetia pacifica (Grosche et al., 2015), and Lebetimonas natsushimae (Nagata et al., 2017) can indirectly relate to the denitrification process as DNRA microorganisms, causing decrease in nitrate, the first substrate of denitrification. The ability of strain HRV44T to utilize not only nitrate but N2O might be one of the niche partitioning strategies for environmental adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal environments where many chemolithoautotrophs utilize nitrate as electron acceptors. N2O emission from the environments is a gross result of the balance between its production and consumption. Although redox gradient around deep-sea hydrothermal vent is conductive to microbial denitrification and nitrification, its contribution to N2O level at deep sea is quite low (Bange and Andreae, 1999). Our results imply members of the genus Nitratiruptor can significantly contribute to the capacity of N2O mitigation of the environments and the magnitude of contribution on the total N2O sink might differ at species or strain levels and be influenced by environmental factors. In addition, not all denitrifying microorganisms might account for the N2O emission as members of Nitratiruptor can utilize exogenous N2O in this study. In deep-sea hydrothermal environments, denitrifying mesophiles and nitrifying microorganisms likely appeared to be the biological sources of excess N2O observed in previous biogeochemical studies (Lilley et al., 1982; Kawagucci et al., 2010). Further comprehensive omics and physiological analysis of deep-sea hydrothermal vent microorganisms will lead us to evaluate the accurate N2O flux in these environments and their contribution to mediate climate change.

Analysis by standard PCR [9,10] and 16S rDNA sequencing demonstrated that two of the discrepant isolates were hippurate-negative C. jejuni strains, resulting in an erroneous phenotypic identification, while the third was an isolate of C. coli that contained a gyrA gene typical of C. jejuni, resulting in misidentification by the FRET assay. This last discrepant result could possibly be explained by horizontal transfer of the gyrA gene from C. jejuni to C. coli. Hakanen et al. [23] have reported horizontal gene transfer between Campylobacter spp., and described six C. jejuni strains that had replaced their gyrA gene with a gene received from C. coli. This transfer involved the conserved region of the gyrA gene associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and resulted in antibiotic resistance. In the present study, which concerned the conserved region of the gyrA gene, this event appeared to be very rare, as it occurred only once (0.13%) among the 775 isolates studied. Accurate species identification of Campylobacter isolates is important because it is the first step in comparing isolates for epidemiological studies; indeed, it is possible that outbreaks have gone unnoticed in the past in the absence of proper identification of Campylobacter spp. Compared to phenotypic tests, the assay described in the present study has a higher specificity.

The Lip2 exhibited maximum synthetic activity at pH 6.0 (136U/mg), however, the synthetic Lip1 showed the optimum at pH memory 7.5 of 36.7U/mg. The Lip2 retained 80% and 71% of its maximum activity at pH 5.5 and 6.5, respectively. Memory of enzymes at alkaline (above 8) pHs resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, probably ascribed to the significant change in ionization state of amino groups in lyophilized proteins with such pH values (Vakos et al., 2000). On the other hand, if the pure enzyme was inactivated when lyophilized under these pHs, huge activity loss will also be consequentially caused.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "A candidate for the gene encoding this enzyme (Rv3806c) was identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily via its homology to one of four genes responsible for d-arabinosylation of nodulation factor in Azorhizobium caulinodans. The resulting protein was predicted to contain eight or nine transmembrane domains. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and membranes from the expression strain of E. coli but not from a control strain of E. coli were shown to convert phosphoribose diphosphate and decaprenyl phosphate into decaprenylphosphoryl-5-phosphoribose. Neither UDP-galactose nor GDP-mannose was active as a sugar donor. The enzyme favored polyprenyl phosphate with 50–60 carbon atoms, was unable to use C-20 polyprenyl phosphate, and used C-75 polyprenyl phosphate less efficiently than C-50 or C-60. It requires CHAPS detergent and Mg2+ for activity. The Rv3806c gene encoding 5-phospho-α-d-ribose-1-diphosphate:decaprenyl-phosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase is known to be essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis, and the tuberculosis drug ethambutol inhibits other steps in arabinan biosynthesis. Thus the Rv3806c-encoded enzyme appears to be a good target for the development of new tuberculosis drugs. The cell wall core of Mycobacterium tuberculosis consists of an inner peptidoglycan layer and an outer lipid mycolic acid layer (1). These two layers are connected by the polysaccharide arabinogalactan (1). The structure of arabinogalactan is conveniently divided into three regions, namely the linker region (2), a d-galactofuranosyl region (3), and an arabinofuranosyl region (3). Enzymes required for arabinogalactan formation have been shown to be essential for mycobacterial growth (4, 5). The donor for the arabinofuranosyl residues has been shown to be decaprenylphosphoryl- d -arabinose (6–8). The carbon atoms of the arabinosyl residue come originally from the pentose shunt (9) and specifically from phosphoribose diphosphate (pRpp) 1 1 The abbreviations used are: pRpp, phosphoribose diphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DP, decaprenyl phosphate; DPPR, decaprenylphosphoryl-5-phosphoribose; DPR, decaprenylphosphoryl-ribose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; p[14C]Rpp, phospho[14C]ribosyl diphosphate; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate; TLC, thin layer chromatography.", "id": 339, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Azorhizobium caulinodans?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "7+Azorhizobium caulinodans"}

Although genetic diversity among P. parsiana isolates was apparent, no particular pattern or consistency in the differences was observed between the different gene phylograms. According to the combined gene tree, isolate SCRP237 (Prunus dulcis, Greece) was basal to other isolates. Isolates SURf6, SURf17, and SUC19 (Pistacia vera isolates, Iran) shared a recent common ancestor, and isolates SUC7 (Pistacia vera, USA) and SUC25 (Ficus carica, Iran) appeared as sister taxa. P. parsiana isolates produce colonies with complex patterns on almost all different types of agar media. Hyphae normally contain abundant, aggregate, botryose to globose hyphal swellings both on agar and in water. Sporangia are non-papillate, persistent (non-caducous), with notable apical pores, which proliferate internally (nesting). Heterothallic or sterile mating systems are observed among isolates. Oospores are plerotic to aplerotic with amphigynous antheridia attached on the base of oospores. Morphological characters of this species indicated some overlaps with high-temperature tolerant Phytophthora species of ITS clades 6, 7 and 8 (Cooke et al. 2000). The majority of the species in ITS clades 6–8 sensu Cooke et al. 2000, are soil-borne, producing non-papillate, non-caducous and proliferating sporangia, and in some cases, are high-temperature tolerant; thus P. parsiana could easily be mistaken for one of these species. Most of the P. parisana isolates were initially misidentified as ‘high-temperature P. cryptogea’ based on sporangial morphology and the high upper temperature limit for growth, which was more than 35°C.

As far as the thermal deactivation is concerned, the productivity fall observed in fermentation processes beyond the optimum temperature could be justified by an increased denaturation rate of one controlling enzyme (XR in this specific case) or, at least, a decrease in its activity. The enzyme denaturation is usually characterised by higher activation enthalpies (60–100 kJ mol−1) [6], which means that the thermal deactivation of an enzyme requires to cross an energy barrier higher than that of enzymatic catalysis. Just for this reason, according to Arrenhius equation, the thermal denaturation rate grows more rapidly with temperature than product formation rate, therefore the overall productivity declines above its maximum value. In this specific case, the activation enthalpy of thermal deactivation was much higher (210.5 kJ mol−1) than that observed for D. hansenii in synthetic solution (130.4 kJ mol−1) [5]. Since this latter yeast showed an optimal temperature for xylitol production (35°C) slightly higher than P. tannophilus (30°C) and productivity values one order of magnitude higher (1.21–4.67 gxyt l−1 h−1), it is reasonable to suppose that, although more sensitive to thermal denaturation, D. hansenii XR exhibits a much higher activity than P. tannophilus XR.", "id": 845, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Pachysolen tannophilus?", "synonym_description": "Pachysolen tannophilus is also known as P. tannophilus.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Conversely, it is extremely probable that the GB accumulated by E. coli strain K12 was derived from the oxidation of choline initially present in SSE. Collectively, our data demonstrate that (i) S. putrefaciens accumulates GB as a compatible solute when cultured in a salt-enriched minimal medium supplied with an extract from smoked salmon, and (ii) taking into account our microbiological evidence that GB is not present in the SSE, in contrast to choline, it can be assumed that S. putrefaciens oxidises choline present in SSE to GB. The ability of a given bacterium to use an osmoprotectant appears strictly correlated to the performance of the systems it can use to transport and accumulate such molecules. Thus, the osmoprotective properties (i.e., uptake and accumulation characteristics) of choline and GB to S. putrefaciens were evaluated. 3.3 Osmoregulated uptake and metabolism of betaines in S. putrefaciens In most bacteria, the osmoprotective activity of GB is closely related to the ability of stressed cells to transport and accumulate it as a compatible solute (Csonka and Hanson, 1991; Kempf and Bremer, 1998). Nevertheless, although choline may act as an osmoprotectant for numerous bacterial species, it is not accumulated as a cytosolic osmolyte but acts as a metabolic precursor of GB (Styrvold et al., 1986; Boch et al., 1994; Pocard et al., 1997). Therefore, uptake, accumulation and metabolism of [methyl-14C]choline and [methyl-14C]GB were examined in S. putrefaciens subjected to increasing concentrations of salt (from 0 to 0.7 M NaCl).", "id": 716, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Shewanella putrefaciens?", "synonym_description": "Shewanella putrefaciens is also known as S. putrefaciens.

Author believes that low δ 13CH4 values of −52‰ to −69‰ may be a result from mixing of methane generated by methanogens with “abiogenic” gases derived from thermal cracking of petroleum. Incidentally, it is the fact that also proves our hypothesis for deep subsurface autotrophic methanogenesis. Such an isotopically heavy CH4 could be produced from heavy CO2 via acetate. Methanogenic Archaea affiliated with the genus Methanobacterium were isolated from deep subsurface (1650 m depth) oil-bearing sedimentary rock and formation water in an old flooded oil-field in Russia (Belyaev et al., 1983, 1986).

For those growing at temperatures below 0°C cold storage would only delay the appearance of the disease or, in other words, would prolong their incubation period (Barkai-Golan, 2001). Considering that the closer is the temperature to the minimum for growth of the pathogen and the longer is the incubation time, a general desire is to lower the storage temperature as much as possible. However, the susceptibility of some fruits or vegetables to chilling injury limit this possibility, being the sensitivity related to the species, cultivars, season, location of the crop, duration of exposure, and state of maturity (Barkai-Golan, 2001). 3 Heat treatments 3.1 Hot water treatments Hot water treatment (HWT) is a non-conventional approach to control postharvest decay based on the use of water at temperature above 40°C. The technique is completely safe for human and environment (residue-free and environment-friendly) and of feasible use without registration rules. For these reasons, HWT appears to be especially recommended for organic crops or to comply with the stringent regulations of markets that require minimal or no chemical postharvest treatment on commodities. The system provides more efficient transfer of heat than air, so needs shorter times of treatment than hot air. In addition, it is cheap when compared to other heat treatments, such as vapor treatment or forced air (Jacobi et al., 2001; Sivakumar and Fallik, 2013). HWT may be suitable also for the control of pests of quarantine importance, such as fruit flies and codling moth (Lay-Yee et al., 1997; Feng et al., 2004). Quarantine treatments by HWT are, for example, used in mango against the Mediterranean and Mexican fruit flies (Ceratitis capitata and Anastrepha ludens) in the USA and Central America.

There was no apparent divalent ion requirement, and 0.04 M EDTA did not inhibit the activity. The enzyme exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent kinetic constants with PNP-β-GlcNAc, calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3 A), were: K m , 440 μM; V max, 1.1 μmol/min × mg protein at 22°C. Effect of GlcNAc on Enzyme Activity Given sufficient time, the rate of the reaction decreases, and this was first observed in the continuous spectrophotometric assay. Several possibilities were tested, and it appeared that we were observing product inhibition. Indeed, GlcNAc inhibits the β-GlcNAcidase. A Dixon plot is shown in Fig. 3 B and suggests that GlcNAc is a noncompetitive inhibitor of ExoII, with an apparent K i of 210 μM. Substrate Specificity The cloned enzyme is an exo-β-GlcNAcidase and hydrolyzes PNP-β-GlcNAc and MUF-β-GlcNAc. The substrate specificity of the enzyme, however, shows that it is not a classical β-GlcNAcidase but is unique. Unlike most β-GlcNAcidases, the enzyme had only a slight, albeit detectable effect with PNP-β-GalNAc. Under standard assay conditions (1 μg of pure enzyme in 400 μl of buffer containing 0.66 mM substrate), PNP-β-GlcNAc was hydrolyzed at a rate of 356 pmol/min, whereas PNP-β-GalNAc was hydrolyzed at a rate of 10 pmol/min, or a ratio of about 36-fold in favor of PNP-β-GlcNAc. It was possible that the GalNAc derivative might be contaminated with small amounts of PNP-β-GlcNAc. Therefore, the following mixture (440 μl) was incubated at 22°C: 330 μM PNP-β-GalNAc, 5 μg of enzyme, 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0. After 16 h, 9% of the substrate was cleaved. This value far exceeded the quantity of PNP-β-GlcNAc that could be a contaminant (based on chromatography of the derivatives). The enzyme was tested for its ability to hydrolyze a variety of p-nitrophenyl D-glycopyranosides, including β-GlcNAc, β-Glc, β-Gal, and β-cellobioside.", "id": 907, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Vibrio furnissii?", "synonym_description": "Vibrio furnissii is also known as V. furnissii.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "The closest relatives of strain MKT110T were found to be Zooshikella ganghwensis JC2044T, Oceanospirillum linum LMG 2864T, Microbulbifer salipaludis SM-1T, Marinobacter lipolyticus SM19T, Saccharospirillum impatiens DSM 12546T, and Pseudomonas gessardii CIP 105469T with 91.4%, 90.9%, 90.6%, 90.0%, 89.9%, and 89.8% similarity, respectively. The phylogenetic position of the novel isolate based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence was shown in Fig. 2 . The phylogenetic tree indicated that strain MKT110T constituted a sister clade of genus Zooshikella and the isolate formed a separate cluster with four clones (AB054136, AB054161, AY700600, AY700601), as indicated by the 100% bootstrap value, thus creating a novel taxon. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between MKT110T and the four clones (AB054136, AB054161, AY700600, and AY700601) were 96.9%, 96.8%, 95.6%, and 95.2%, respectively. In a previous study, the genus Zooshikella was suggested to be a sister taxon to the genus Hahella clade in a neighbor-joining tree based on nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences [14]. However, this study showed that Zooshikella constituted a sister clade of strain MKT110T and the clade that contained both genera was more closely related to Oceanospirillum, Microbulbifer, Marinobacter, Saccharospirillum and Pseudomonas than to the genus Hahella. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between MKT110T and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396T or H. ganghwensis FR1050T were only 88.8% and 89.1%, respectively. Discussion The isolate MKT110T had <92% similarity with the species that have validly published names. Neighbor-joining analyses placed MKT110T in the γ-subclass of the proteobacteria, and the closest cultured bacterial relatives were Zooshikella, Oceanospirillum, Microbulbifer, Marinobacter, Saccharospirillum, and Pseudomonas. Among them, Zooshikella was the most closely related with the isolate on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. The similarity between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain MKT110T and Zooshikella was 91.4%, which was higher than the similarity between MKT110T and any of the other validly published names. The sister relationship of strain MKT110T to genus Zooshikella is supported with a bootstrap value of 88%. However, MKT110T was clearly different from Zooshikella in colony color, maximum growth temperature, G+C content and hydroxy fatty acid profile. The colony color of MKT110T is beige, while that of Zooshikella is yellowish-red or red. MKT110T cannot grow at a temperature of more than 37°C, but Zooshikella can grow at 45°C. The DNA G+C content of strain MKT110T was 50.5mol%, while that of Zooshikella was 40–42mol%. 3-OH 14:0 of hydroxy fatty acid was present in the isolate MKT110T but not in genus Zooshikella. These characteristics clearly distinguish the isolate and Zooshikella. MKT110T is significantly distinguishable from Oceanospirillum, Microbulbifer, Marinobacter, Saccharospirillum and Pseudomonas by the difference in fatty acid profile, the very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, and the formation of a distinctive phylogenetic position. On the basis of the above data, MKT110T can be assigned to a novel genus in the γ-proteobacteria from the point of view of both phenotype and genotype.", "id": 1169, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Saccharospirillum impatiens?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "169438+Saccharospirillum impatiens"}

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Only one species has been isolated from a human: Aeromicrobium massiliense [15]. Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843T was isolated using the culturomics approach, which is based on using a large panel of culture conditions to describe the microbial composition of a sample by high-throughput culture [16–18]. A taxonogenomics approach including matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), phylogenetic analysis, main phenotypic description and genome sequencing was used to describe this species [19,20]. The genome of Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843T is 3 270 508 bp long with 70.96% G + C content. This new bacterium is most closely related to Aeromicrobium choanae strain 9H-4 16S with a 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence similarity value of 99.46%. Genomic comparison using OrthoANI parameters provided a value of 93.67% and a digital DNA-DNA hybridization value of 21.8% (19.5–24.2) with Aeromicrobium choanae strain 9H-4. On the basis of these data, we propose Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843T, a new member of the Aeromicrobium genus, as the type strain. Materials and methods Strain isolation and phenotypic tests Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843T was isolated from a swab sample taken from the skin of the back of the hand a 61-year-old healthy woman. Sampling was performed in the CosNat Provence laboratory (https://cosnat-loccitane.com, Marseille area, France). Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843T was initially isolated by direct seeding of 50 μL of sample on Columbia agar with 5% sheep's blood media (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) incubated in aerobiosis at 31°C. MALDI-TOF MS protein analysis was carried out with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) [8]. Spectra from strain Marseille-Q0843T were imported into MALDI BioTyper 3.0 software (Bruker) and analysed by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings). The study was validated by the local ethics committee (ID-RCB: 2019-A01508-49). Phenotypic characterization Different growth temperatures (21, 28, 30, 37, 45 and 56°C), atmospheric conditions, anaerobic, aerobic and microaerophilic atmospheres (CampyGEN; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and pH (5,5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5) were tested. API ZYM, 20 NE and 50 CH strips (bioMérieux) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions to evaluate the strain's biochemical properties. For scanning electronic microscopy, a colony was collected from agar and immersed into a 2.5% glutaraldehyde fixative solution. The slide was gently washed in water, air dried and examined with approximately 60 cm in height and 33 cm in width between the microsocpe detector and the slide to evaluate the bacterial structure using a TM4000Plus tabletop microscope (Hitachi High-Tech, Tokyo, Japan). A sporulation test was performed by applying a heat shock to the bacteria for 20 minutes at 80°C. Motility test was performed using the semi solid 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TCC) media as described by Tittsler and Sandholzer [21]. Genome sequencing Genomic DNA (gDNA) of Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843T was extracted in two steps: a mechanical treatment was first performed by glass beads acid washed (G4649-500g; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) using a FastPrep-24 5G Grinder (mpBio, Santa Ana, CA, USA) at maximum speed (setting 6.5) for 90 seconds. After 30 minutes' lysozyme incubation at 37°C, DNA was extracted using the EZ1 biorobot (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) with the EZ1 DNA tissue kit. The elution volume was 50 μL. gDNA of Aeromicrobium phoceense strain Marseille-Q0843 was quantified by a Qubit assay with the high sensitivity kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to 0.2 ng/μL.", "id": 1143, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Aeromicrobium massiliense?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "1464554+Aeromicrobium massiliense"}

Thus, we searched for nucleotide sequences of L. plantarum WCFS1 similar to tanA using the BLAST program, and found that an ORF, designated as lp2956, encoding a “hypothetical protein,” had 46.7% similarity to tanA. Therefore, this study describes cloning a gene (tanLpl) that encodes for the tannase of L. plantarum ATCC 14917T on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of tanA and lp2956, characterization of the recombinant enzyme (TanLpl), and the finding that the enzyme is a novel tannase with different properties from other known tannases.

These species produce mycotoxins such as roquefortines, MPA and agroclavine; in addition, P. paneum produces PAT. Studies carried out in Denmark, with a colder climate than in the North of Portugal, reported the presence of these two species in 96% of the silages studied (Storm et al., 2010b). As expected, Fusarium species, commonly present in forage crops in the field, were found in a very low percentage of silage samples (Fig. 1). It has been previously reported their inability to persist in ensiled plant material since they do not survive at the low oxygen and low pH environment of silage (Mansfield and Kuldau, 2007). Other species isolated with a high frequency in our study were D. geotrichum and M. circinelloides although they are not related to mycotoxin production (Driehuis, 2013). The isolation frequency was also studied in relation to the season in which samples were taken, namely fall, winter, and summer. As shown in Fig. 2A, the incidence of A. fumigatus varied among seasons: the lowest percentage of samples contaminated with this fungus was found in winter (54.5%), while the maximum in summer (80%). These data reinforce the hypothesis that the huge differences in the occurrence of A. fumigatus previously found in silage may be caused by climatic variations (Storm et al., 2010a). In fact, it was determined that the most important parameter on the growth rate of this species is temperature, with the faster growth at 37 °C (Alonso et al., 2017). This temperature corresponds to the maximum temperature (average of maximum temperatures 26.7 °C) reached in summer in the region where samples were taken (Fig. S1). On the contrary, climatic variations did not affect the incidence of A. flavus, although the optimal growth temperature for the fungus is 35 °C, which is usually related to the higher isolation frequency of this species in warm climates (Ferrero et al., 2019). In the case of P. paneum and M. circinelloides, the highest isolation frequency was found in fall.

Materials and methods Strains CDC 2478-85 and CDC 2555-87 were obtained from the “Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo” as Aeromonas sp. CECT 4254 and Aeromonas sp. CECT 5178. Strain CDC 2478-85 was isolated from the leg wound of a patient in New Orleans (LA, USA) and was originally described as Enteric Group 501 and distinguished from A. schubertii by DNA–DNA hybridization and phenotypical characterization [9]. Strain CDC 2555-87 was also isolated from a leg wound of a patient in New Orleans and was originally described as biochemically similar and highly related by DNA–DNA hybridization to strain CDC 2478-85 in an Addendum in Proof in the same paper [9]. The following physiological and biochemical tests were performed at 30°C and determined as described previously [23]: Gram-staining, motility, glucose oxidation–fermentation, oxidase and catalase activity, nitrate reduction, susceptibility to O/129, swarming motility, indole production, production of a brown diffusible pigment, gas production from d-glucose, methyl red and Voges–Proskauer reactions, arginine dihydrolase and lysine and ornithine decarboxylase activity (Moeller’s method), ONPG, hydrogen sulphide production from cysteine and thiosulfate, growth on MacConkey agar, m-Aeromonas-selective agar base Havelaar and TCBS agar, salt tolerance, pH and temperature ranges for growth, hydrolysis of aesculin, arbutin, DNA, elastin, erythrocytes, gelatine, starch and xanthine, acid production from 17 carbohydrates, utilization of 32 substrates as sole carbon and energy sources and sensitivity to 18 antibiotics. The type strain of A. schubertii (CIP 103437T) was also included in this phenotypic study. Genomic DNA from the type strain of Aeromonas sp. HG13 was prepared using a modification of the procedure of Wilson [31] for the determination of DNA G+C content. The G+C content was determined by three independent analyses via the HPLC technique [21]. These analyses were performed by the BCCMTM/LMG Identification Service. DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing of gyrB for the strains CDC 2478-85T and CDC 2555-87 and 16S rRNA, cpn60, dnaJ and rpoD genes for the strain CDC 2555-87 were performed using previously described methods [15,23,24,25,29].", "id": 1024, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Aeromonas encheleia?", "synonym_description": "Aeromonas encheleia is also known as A. encheleia.

As these values are lower than the 95% threshold for delineating a new genus as suggested by Stackebrandt and Ebers [15], strain Marseille-P1302 was considered as representative of a putatively new genus within the family Propionibacteriaceae in the phylum Actinobacteria. 3.2 Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features The growth of strain Marseille-P1302, was observed on 5% sheep blood–enriched Columbia agar at 37 °C (bioMerieux). Optimal growth of strain Marseille P1302 was obtained in aerobic atmosphere, but weak growth was also observed in microaerophillic and anaerobic conditions. The colonies of strain Marseille-P1302 were β-haemolytic. On blood-enriched agar, colonies were smooth and transparent, with a diameter of 0.2–0.4 mm. Bacterial cells were non motile, non sporulating and coccoid with a diameter of 0.8–1.0 μm (Fig. 2). Bacterial Cells were Gram-positive (Fig. 3 ) and exhibited catalase but no oxidase activity (Table 1 ). Using an API 50CH strip (bioMérieux), after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, strain Marseille-P1302 was able to metabolize d-galactose, d-glucose, d-fructose, N-acetylglucosamine, esculine, d-maltose, d-lactose, d-saccharose, d-turanose and D-arabitol.

An API ZYM strip (bioMérieux) showed the presence of leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, naphthol-AS-B1-phosphohydrolase, β-galactosidase, α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase activities whereas negative reactions were obtained for alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), lipase (C14), cystine arylamidase, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, acid phosphatase, α-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, α-mannosidase and α-fucosidase. By comparison with compared species, strain Marseille-P1302 differed in a combination of alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8) and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activities. The phenotypic comparison with other related strains is detailed in Table 1 [36–46]. Strain Marseille-P1302 was resistant to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole but was susceptible to amoxicillin, rifampin and colistin. FAME analysis revealed that the major cellular fatty acids found in strain Marseille-P1302 was 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (89%), followed by 12-methyl-Tridecanoic acid (4%) and Hexadecanoic acid (2%). These fatty acids were principally saturated structures, half of them presenting branches.", "id": 935, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Microlunatus phosphovorus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "29405+Microlunatus phosphovorus"}

The concept of using cocktail inocula was introduced for physiological studies on foodborne bacterial pathogens, particularly in acquisition of data for predictive modelling studies, as a way of determining the extremes of growth limits for particular species. The use of bulked spore suspensions was applied for the first time to studies on the a w tolerances of fungi by Hocking and Miscamble (1995). Although this approach can be criticized because of loss of information about the responses of individual strains of a species, it is accepted as a legitimate method for establishing the most extreme conditions under which a particular species is capable of growth. The use of a cocktail inoculum in the present study provided data closer to the real conditions at which tomato and tomato products are exposed. A synthetic medium (TPA) similar to tomato fruits composition was developed. Its use provides a practical advantage because it simplifies the determination of germination time and the measurement of colony diameter, which would be difficult to perform on tomato fruits. The range of temperatures selected for the present study is representative of ambient temperatures at which tomato fruits are stored in warm temperate regions such as our country in the different seasons (35 °C, 21 °C, and 15 °C, in summer, autumn and winter respectively); and 6 °C was selected as a refrigeration temperature.", "id": 691, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Alternaria alternata?", "synonym_description": "Alternaria alternata is also known as A. alternata.

This figure also shows how thermostability is increased when the enzyme is immobilised on a nanoparticle support. The free enzyme retained more than 50% of its activity after incubation at 69 °C for 1.5 h while the immobilised form retained more than 50% activity for roughly two hours under the same conditions. After three hours, the free enzyme became inactivated while the immobilised form still retained ca 20% activity. In terms of thermostability, the S. griseus enzyme is comparable to β-glucosidases commonly used for biocatalytic applications ([17–19]). Thus, it is somewhat better than the thermostable β-glucosidase from Penicillium citrinum that has an optimum temperature of 70 °C but becomes inactivated above 60 °C ([23]) or that from Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 ([17]) which had maximal activity at 60 °C but lost activity rapidly above this temperature. On the other hand, some highly thermostable enzymes have been reported: the glucosidase recently described from H. orenii retained more than 90% of its activity after 3 h of incubation at 65 °C ([24]) while that from Dictyoglomus thermophilum reportedly retained a remarkable 70–80% of its initial activity after 7 days of incubation at 70 °C ([25]).", "id": 354, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Dictyoglomus thermophilum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "14+Dictyoglomus thermophilum"}

At temperatures below 10°C, the fluidity of cell membrane is drastically reduced and the metabolism slows down. At the optimum temperature, the metabolic activity is maximal; the genetic material is unpacked and completely active, and therefore more vulnerable to oxidative stress due to increased surface of DNA [37]. The reduced SOS response in E. coli when temperature increases from 10 to 20°C, being constant until 40°C has been proven [38]. In our results, when temperatures raised from 15 to 35°C, we observed an increase in efficiency of the disinfection process, which can be explained by the increased activity of the metabolism of bacteria cells; while no significant different results were observed between 35 and 45°C, as at these temperatures there are no metabolic differences in the bacteria.", "id": 1167, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Fusarium solani?", "synonym_description": "Fusarium solani is also known as F. solani.

The ability of strain HRV44T to utilize not only nitrate but N2O might be one of the niche partitioning strategies for environmental adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal environments where many chemolithoautotrophs utilize nitrate as electron acceptors. N2O emission from the environments is a gross result of the balance between its production and consumption. Although redox gradient around deep-sea hydrothermal vent is conductive to microbial denitrification and nitrification, its contribution to N2O level at deep sea is quite low (Bange and Andreae, 1999). Our results imply members of the genus Nitratiruptor can significantly contribute to the capacity of N2O mitigation of the environments and the magnitude of contribution on the total N2O sink might differ at species or strain levels and be influenced by environmental factors. In addition, not all denitrifying microorganisms might account for the N2O emission as members of Nitratiruptor can utilize exogenous N2O in this study. In deep-sea hydrothermal environments, denitrifying mesophiles and nitrifying microorganisms likely appeared to be the biological sources of excess N2O observed in previous biogeochemical studies (Lilley et al., 1982; Kawagucci et al., 2010). Further comprehensive omics and physiological analysis of deep-sea hydrothermal vent microorganisms will lead us to evaluate the accurate N2O flux in these environments and their contribution to mediate climate change.

(2016), the belonging of this species needs further study. Clade classification in section Nidulantes Matsuzawa et al. (2012) performed the first multilocus analysis based on BenA, CaM and actin in the genus Emericella, eight clades were introduced for 37 species, clades I, II, III, IV, V and VI are equal with our A. nidulans clade, clades VII and VIII are equal with our A. stellatus clade, anamorphic species were not included in their analysis. Hubka et al. (2016) constructed a phylogenetic analysis for section Nidulantes, six statistically supported clades were designated, namely clades A. aeneus, A. spelunceus, A. versicolor, A. stellatus, A. nidulans and A. unguis, five of them are confirmed in our study, while Aspergillus aeneus clade is treated as section Aenei as discussed above. Besides these clades, additional two clades are introduced here, namely clades A. aurantiobrunneus and A. multicolor. The A. aurantiobrunneus clade contains A. aurantiobrunneus and A. purpureus. Hubka et al. (2016) included A. aurantiobrunneus in A. spelunceus clade although the grouping was not well supported (100/80/1 ML/MP/PP), A. purpureus was not included in their study. In our study, these two species form a full supported branch (1 pp, 100 % ML), morphologically they all produce globose and subglobose ascospores and grow restrictedly on all tested media. In contrast all species in A. spelunceus clade are anamorphic, and grow faster. Another newly introduced clade is A. multicolor clade, this clade contains A. multicolor, A. mulundensis and A. pluriseminatus, and is close related with A. nidulans clade. No species in this clade grow at 40 °C, A. pluriseminatus, the only homothallic species in this clade produces stellate ascospores, which show more similarity with species in A. stellatus clade.

However, a phylogenetic analysis of GH94 phosphorylases indicated that CABP is distantly related to members that are characterized and have known structures with very low amino acid sequence identity (21–24%) (16). In this study, we characterized another CBAP enzyme (Sde_0906; SdCBAP) from the genome of the marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans that can degrade various polysaccharides, including cellulose (24). Biochemical and structural characterization of SdCBAP revealed the detailed molecular mechanism of the key metabolic enzyme that connects the oxidative cellulose degradation and downstream pathways. Experimental Procedures Chemicals G1P (disodium salt hydrate), GlcA (sodium salt), and GlcUA (sodium salt) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), and Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), respectively. CbA and Glc-β1,3-GlcUA were produced by the synthetic reaction of XcCBAP and purified as described previously (16).

To determine chemotaxonomical markers, a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of P. entomophila L48T and its closely related type strains was performed at Anagnosteg GmbH (Germany) [8] as described by Scotta et al. [20]. The profile of peaks obtained for each species was analysed and compared using the software BGP database available at the website http://sourceforge.net/projects/bgp. A dendrogram was generated using the Permutmatrix programme, applying average linkage method (UPGMA hierarchical clustering) and Pearson's distance correlation [1]. The duplicate or quadruplicate whole cell spectra profiles for each strain analysed clustered at least with a 60% similarity. Spectra of two different type strains were less than 50% similar. In the MALDI-TOF MS analysis P. entomophila L48T showed twenty-two single m/z peaks (supermass values) not present in the other strains. These data further support the conclusion that P. entomophila strain L48T is a distinct species and is separate from all other Pseudomonas species, even at the level of expression of the most abundant cellular proteins as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. Additionally, gas chromatography of cell fatty acids methyl esters composition (CFA) was determined at the CCUG (Culture collection, University of Göteborg, Sweden) using a standardized protocol, similar to that of the MIDI Scherlock MIS system (http://www.ccug.se/pages/CFAmethod2008.pdf).

The cat presented otalgia and erythema, hyperplasia of the ear canals, pruritus and a dark secretion with a characteristic odour. Samples were obtained by sterile swab from both ear canals. The swabs, processed by the Microbiology Laboratory of the Department of Pathology and Animal Health of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, were used for cytological examination and culturing. For cytological analysis, cotton-tipped swabs of ear canal exudates were streaked onto glass slides, which were then heat-fixed and stained with a modified Wright's stain (Diff Quik, Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL). All slides were examined at 1000× magnification (high power under oil immersion). This technique allows for microscopic visualization of any microorganisms that reside within the ear canal cerumen, and a minimum number of yeast cells per oil immersion field (>5yeast/field) indicates excessive colonization by the organism (i.e., infection). Culture analyses for the identification of Malassezia species were performed using cotton-tipped swabs of the ear canal exudates streaked onto Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol (Oxoid Microbiology Products, Italy).

Strain Safen was able to grow in the presence of 3.0% (v/v) ethanol without previous adaptation: its high tolerance further confirms the industrial potential of this strain; moreover, both nitrate and nitrite reduction was observed. 3.2 Stability and swelling of the immobilizing matrices The selection of the materials to be used as immobilizing carriers was conditioned to the specific growth parameters for Safen cultivation. In particular, temperature and ionic strength of the medium were considered, as well as the interaction between cells and hydrogels and the possibility to recycle polymeric carriers. Alginate is one of the most used immobilization material due to its biocompatibility and gelling capacity in presence of bivalent ions. However, alginate hydrogels are sensitive to high concentrations of sodium ions, which are able to weaken the gel structure, eventually leading to its disruption (Gomez d’Ayala et al., 2008). Besides, the thermophilic bacterial strain used in the present work had an optimal growth temperature of 60°C, which could potentially damage the immobilizing polymers. Therefore, all the matrices were incubated at 40, 60 and 80°C in presence of elevated concentrations of sodium ions, to investigate on their long-term stability. The incubated materials were filtered and the recovered solid was rinsed with water and weighted. The acrylic matrices showed to be very stable, as about 95wt.% solid was recovered even at higher ionic strength and temperatures above 80°C. The polysaccharide-based hydrogels were less stable as approximately 85wt.% suspended material remained after incubation of CA and GCH for 48h at 80°C. CA was more sensitive to high ionic strength, since it was partially dissolved after a 24-h treatment at 80°C in presence of 100g/L NaCl. Nevertheless, it was found to be rather stable under the conditions used for hydrogen production, i.e. T =60°C and 10g/L NaCl, and even longer incubation periods did not cause further weakening of the gel structure.", "id": 1259, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum?", "synonym_description": "Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum is also known as T. thermosaccharolyticum.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Zimmer and Crothers [28] were the first to use isotope labeled dNMPs that were obtained by nuclease digestion of nucleic acids extracted from M. methylotrophus. After separation from rNMPs using boronate column chromatography, dNMPs were phosphorylated to yield dNTPs by using pyruvate kinase, myokinase, guanylate kinase and the kinasing fraction of E. coli. This procedure was followed by Smith et al. [29], who cultivated E. coli MY285 on 13C-glucose and 15NH4Cl M9 minimal media, but improved dNTP synthesis by using NMP kinase instead of the kinasing fraction of E. coli and a GST-fusion of dTMP kinase for efficient phosphorylation of dCMP and dTMP, respectively. Masse et al. [30] applied this phosphorylation strategy and additionally separated the four dNTPs by preparative reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC. Werner et al. [31] described the high cell density growth of 13C, 15N-labeled E. coli BL21 in a controlled fermenter and a HPLC purification strategy of the individual dNMPs and additionally used recombinant dCMP kinase to specifically phosphorylate dCMP. Uniform 13C-labeling of nucleotides in E. coli has also been accomplished by using 13C2-acetate [32,33] as the carbon source. Hoffman and Holland [32] further demonstrated that by growing E. coli on 1-13C-acetate >90% of the purines C4 and C6 and >95% of the pyrimidines C2 and C4 contained a 13C-label whereas the other ring carbons were less than 5% 13C-labeled. By using 2-13C-acetate >95% of the C2, C5 and C8 in the purines and >90% of the C5 and C6 were 13C-labeled whereas the other carbons were <5% 13C-labeled. The ribose carbons C4′ and C5′ were >90% 13C-labeled when grown on 2-13C-acetate, whereas these levels were <5% when grown on 1-13C-acetate. Using these carbon sources distinct labeling patterns of the ribose C1′, C2′ and C3′ were also observed although with a somewhat higher scrambling percentage. Thus, complementary incorporation percentages of site-specific labels can be introduced using different growth media, which was used to facilitate NMR assignment of the sugar and base proton and carbon resonances. To overcome interference from strong 13C-13C couplings, uniform random fractional labeling of nucleic acids has been applied by growing Methylobacterium extorquens on 30% 13C-methanol [34,35] and Bacillus subtilis on 15% 13C6-glucose [36].", "id": 365, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Methylophilus methylotrophus?", "synonym_description": "Methylophilus methylotrophus is also known as M. methylotrophus.

The mAbs reacted with whole cell antigens in ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays. The mAbs did not show any cross reactivity in rapid dot ELISA or immunoblot assay with Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli. Treatment of whole cell suspension with proteinase K and sodium periodate indicated that the reacting epitopes of the mAbs were protein in nature. The genus-specific antigens were identified as heat-stable proteins with molecular weight in the range of 26 to 45 kDa. Immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling studies showed that the antibody-binding epitopes were exposed on the outer-surface of the spirochaetal cell wall. The mAbs inhibited growth of reference strains of both S. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens in vitro but failed to cause agglutination. The detection of spirochaetal forms directly in fecal smears or paraffin-embeded tissue sections from experimentally infected pigs indicated that such mAbs were potentially useful for the diagnosis of swine spirochaetosis.

Nevertheless, this bacterium is not ubiquitous in soils, and we assume that the 13C-enriched MAGE 16:0 in the CO2 vent soil derives from SRB (see Section 4.3.1) or from mesophilic relatives of thermophilic Bacteria (see Section 4.3.4). 4.4 Changes in the archaeal community The gene copy numbers of Archaea were slightly lower in the CO2 vent soil than at the reference site (Fig. 10), which does not correlate with the concentrations of archaeol (Fig. 5). Archaeol is widely distributed in Archaea and is therefore used as a biomarker for this domain. However, some Archaea possess only minor amounts of archaeol. This is especially true of the thermophilic Archaea that contain as little as 0.1% diethers in their lipid fraction (Langworthy and Pond, 1986). The dominant archaeal lipids in our samples were GDGTs VII–XIII (Figs. 2, 7 and 8). 4.4.1 Crenarchaeota Crenarchaeota are especially widespread in marine environments (Karner et al., 2001; Sinninghe Damsté et al., 2002), but are also found in terrestrial settings (Bintrim et al., 1997; Jurgens et al., 1997). A diagnostic biomarker for Crenarchaeota is crenarchaeol, GDGT XIII built of one dicyclic and one tricyclic biphytane (Fig. 2). In addition to crenarchaeol, Crenarchaeota are also known to contain other GDGTs (DeLong et al., 1998). De Rosa et al. (1980) showed that the numbers of cyclisations within the biphytanes of the archaeal GDGTs strongly depend on the growth temperature. The number of cyclisations within GDGTs of Sulfolobus solfataricus, which has a growth optimum of 75°C, decreased as the growth temperature decreased.", "id": 567, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Mycoplasmopsis fermentans?", "synonym_description": "Mycoplasmopsis fermentans is also known as Mycoplasma fermentans.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Interestingly, the keratinolytic activity of A. solani (AsK) reached its maximum level on day 11. This might be because of feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its further production. Furthermore, it has been reported that keratinase is mainly produced during the late exponential or stationary phase of microbial growth (11,21,36). The presence of secreted proteases (serine, aspartyl, and metalloproteases) appears to be widespread among the filamentous fungi. There are only a few reports on the presence of cysteine protease, but most of the keratinolytic enzymes belong to the subtilisin family of serine with cysteine protease, which had higher activity on casein (10). However, the enzyme produced by A. solani seems to be belonging to metalloprotease type, since EDTA inhibited it, but not by PMSF. The optimum temperature for AsK was observed to be 45–50° C.

Ruegeria is a recently introduced genus (Uchino et al., 1998). Prior to its introduction, the bacteria, which now belong to it, were classified as marine Agrobacterium (Rueger and Hoefle, 1992). This earlier classification had been based on a variety of physiological and genetic properties that suggested that this group of closely related marine bacteria, originally isolated from the Baltic Sea and later found in the Atlantic, formed a distinct subdivision of the genus Agrobacterium (Rueger and Hoefle, 1992). Only a detailed analysis of 16S rDNA sequences resulted in a description of the novel genus Ruegeria (Uchino et al., 1998). Besides 16S rDNA sequence, isolate PR1b has additional characteristics that support its classification as a member of the genus Ruegeria (Rueger and Hoefle, 1992; Uchino et al., 1998). It is a Gram-negative, motile, rod shaped bacterium about 2μm in length. It forms smooth creamy-colored colonies on M7 solid medium and grows as distinctive star-shaped aggregates in M10 liquid medium.

As shown in Fig. 3 a , the FT-IR spectrum revealed the presence of intense absorption bands at 1724 and 1281cm−1 which correspond to the ester carbonyl group (CO) and to theCH group, respectively (Hong et al., 1999; Bayari and Severcan, 2005).

Despite having abundant renewable energy resources, the sharp growing demand has led to countrywide energy crisis which threatens the economic growth. These challenges require a multipronged approach that would address both the immediate energy shortage, help to build long-term energy sufficiency and reduce environmental pollution by adopting an alternative energy source like biofuel. Therefore, lignocellulosic plant biomass is an essential renewable and economical energy source, which can be used as a substrate for biofuel production, composite with three biopolymers i.e., cellulose (approximately 40–55%), hemicellulose (25–50%) and lignin (10–40%) [1,2]. Cellulose, the most abundant natural carbohydrate and the main component of plant cell walls, is composed of d-glucose units linked together to form linear chains via β-1,4-glycosidic linkages [3]. Non-edible cellulosic plant biomass is a significant alternative energy source to cope with the problem of food and energy with explosive increase in human population. Cellulosic wastes are the chief source of biomass which constitutes switch grasses, agricultural residues (rice hulls, corn fiber, sugarcane bagasse and wheat bran etc. ), municipal and industrial superfluous material. These raw materials are inexpensive, easily accessible, environmentally sound, unexploited, and inexhaustible great potential resource for biofuel production [4]. The limiting factor of bioethanol production is the conversion of cellulose to fermentable sugars; however, the rigid and complex structure of cellulose is a major bottleneck preventing the development of cost-effective production methods. Consequently, cellulosic biodegradation using thermostable cellulolytic enzymes is the most suitable way. Cellulases require less energy and mild environmental conditions to convert biomass into fermentable sugars that are used to make many important bio-based industrial products, which can replace fossil fuels [1,2]. β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21), widely distributed in nature, are considered to be a significant component of cellulase system. It acts on cellobiose, alkyl- and aryl-β-d-glucosides in β-1,4-glucosidic linkage, exhibits transglycosylase and alkyl transferase activities, and catalyzes the synthesis of glycoconjugates and alkyl glucosides [5]. During saccharification of cellulosic biomass, cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides are produced by synergistic action of cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) and endoglucanases (EGs), which are subsequently hydrolyzed by β-glucosidases to produce glucose.", "id": 1072, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermotoga petrophila?", "synonym_description": "Thermotoga petrophila is also known as RKU-1.

Desulfovibrio sp., commonly found in wastewater treatment systems, is very versatile and capable of adaptation in oxygen, forming aggregates or migrating to anoxic zones, or they may alternatively use oxygen as an electron acceptor [44,45]. An interesting feature of SRB is their capacity to perform acetogenic oxidation in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic methanogens, as described in cocultures with Desulfovibrio sp. using lactate and ethanol [3,35]. Furthermore, SRB can reduce oxygen using the same organic substrates applied in the sulfate reduction, such as hydrogen, lactate, alcohols, acetate, and others, and oxidize reduced sulfur compounds to hydrogen sulfide in the aerobic respiration [46]. It was possible to conclude that this population was present in all the nutritional conditions (Fig. 4b) due to its metabolic adaptability. Uncultured eubacterium (AF050594) was previously studied in the evaluation of microbial diversity in an aquifer contaminated with hydrocarbon and chlorinated solvent and undergoing intrinsic bioremediation [47]. Moreover, uncultured bacterium (DQ191727) was identified in a study of microbial community dynamics of psychrophilic anaerobic bioreactors treating pharmaceutical wastewater that contained solvent (Enright et al., 2005, unpublished). The band B3 represented phylogeny closely related to Desulfobacter sp. It was also similar to the morphology observed by optical microscopy (Fig. 2c) and FISH. Laanbroek [48] noted that Desulfobacter sp. was less competitive in ethanol and sulfate than Desulfovibrio sp. and Desulfobulbus sp.; on the other hand, Desulfobacter sp. presented the highest maximum specific growth rate among these three sulfate reducers in the presence of excess ethanol and sulfate. However, Desulfobacter sp. has the particular ability to use acetate in the presence of sulfate [35].

Furthermore, the peptidoglycan of strains RF6T and RB10T contained alanine as an N-terminal of the interpeptide bridge that makes their peptidoglycan different from all others previously described structures containing DAB. The different peptydoglycan types of these organisms coupled to the low DNA:DNA reassociation values between each other and the type strains of the genus Leucobacter strongly support the opinion that strains RF6T and RB10T represent two new species of this genus. On the basis of the distinctive peptidoglycan composition, 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, DNA: DNA reassociation values, fatty acid composition, and physiological and biochemical characteristics we propose that strains RF6T represents a new species of the genus Leucobacter for which we offer the name L. luti sp. nov., and strain RB10T represents a new species of the same genus for which we offer the name L. alluvii, sp. nov.

In addition, amino-terminal truncations were produced, because a previous study indicated involvement of the human Pur-α amino terminus in binding to ssDNA (23). All specifically mutated Bpur residues are described in Table 2 , and locations of mutations that affected Bpur functions are depicted in Fig. 2. Of these, three mutations had significant effects on the binding of one or more, but not all, substrates. Those differences indicate distinct interactions with each type of ligand. Because each of these mutations did not disturb interactions with at least one ligand, it is clear that the effects were not simply due to gross protein misfolding. Mutant Bpur-Q75A contains a substitution of glutamine 75 to alanine, near the α-helix's carboxyl end. Bpur-Q75A exhibited significantly reduced affinity for both dsDNA and RNA, with negligible binding observed even when using the highest possible concentrations of protein, and KD values could not be calculated for either ligand (Fig. 11 , A and B). In contrast, the affinity of Bpur-Q75A for ssDNA was not significantly different from that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 11 C). Opposite effects were observed with mutant Bpur-E63A/S64A, which contains alanines substituted for glutamate 63 and serine 64, near the amino end of the α-helix. Bpur-E63A/S64A bound both dsDNA and RNA with the same affinities as did the wild-type protein, yet did not detectably bind ssDNA (Fig. 11, A–C). Even more striking was mutant Bpur-ΔN, which lacks the two amino-terminal β-strands. This mutation removed 23% of the Bpur protein, yet did not have any significant effects upon binding to RNA, and it reduced the affinity for dsDNA by only 2-fold (Fig. 11, A and B).

In addition, various strains from Candida sp. Have become an essential source for producing D-arabitol from d -glucose. In 2001, Zakaria documented a novel strain from Candida sp (Candida famata R28) that produced D-arabitol as a single product when cultured in a d -glucose-containing medium. Around 50% of D-arabitol from d -glucose was synthesized from this source (Zakaria, 2001). Another Candida strain (C. pelliculosa) was also found to produce D-arabitol from d -glucose and d -ribose as a byproduct (De Wulf et al., 1996). Similar studies reporting D-arabitol in Candida species include C. utilis, C. albicans and P. chrysogenum, where D-arabitol was synthesized as an intermediate product during interconversion of aldose ketose (Saha et al., 2007). This was confirmed when Wong et al., in 1993, reported D-arabitol synthesis in C. albicans where ribulose-5-phosphate is dephosphorylated and reduced to D-arabitol (Wong et al., 1993). Later, after the U.S. Department of Energy has announced its inclusion in top-twelve energy building blocks for biorefinery, research focusing on D-arabitol producing microorganisms using other carbon sources have started to grow steadily. Glycerol is a byproduct of the biodiesel industry, and processes for its expedient production as a substrate for direct fermentation of D-arabitol could be envisaged. Further, the isolation of yeasts involved in producing D-arabitol from glycerol might help them reach the industries.

The strain D1 showed gradual increase in amylase production and optimum pH for enzyme production was found to be 9. The enzyme was found to be stable in different buffer as it retained almost 80% in phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 60% of its activity in disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 12) but optimum amylase activity was obtained in glycine–NaOH buffer having pH 9 (Fig. 5b). Research was focused on the isolation of alkaline amylase enzyme from microbes because there is tremendous potentiality of alkaline enzymes in detergent industry [24].

Maximum amylase production was obtained at 45°C and enzyme retained almost 50% of its activity at 85°C (Fig. 6 ). This clearly indicates moderately thermostable nature of enzyme.

Metal ions such as K+ have no effect on amylase activity (Table 2 ). In previous reports, most of the amylase activity was inhibited in the presence of Ni2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+. The α-amylase from Bacillus sp. KSM-1378 [34] and Bacillus firmus [27] were strongly inhibited by Ni2+, Cd2+, Zn2+ and Hg2+.

Enzyme activity decreased drastically in presence of EDTA (5 and 10mM) which provides evidence that this amylase is calcium ion dependent. EDTA forms complex with the Ca2+ which is required for activity and stability of enzyme, therefore causing decrease in enzyme production and activity. Effect of various chemicals on amylase activity was recorded in Table 2. 3.6 Repression study with glucose Strong catabolic repression was observed with glucose as amylase production (Fig. 7a) and activity (Fig. 7b) decreased drastically with increase in glucose concentration from 0.5 to 2% (w/v). However, growth slightly increased up to 2% (w/v) of glucose. A similar behaviour was reported in case of alkaline protease from an alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. [5] and amylase production from marine yeast Aerobasidium pullulans [37]. 3.7 Stability studies of amylase Isolated amylase was found to be moderately salt tolerant. Enzyme activity drastically decreased in presence of 0% (w/v) of NaCl after 48h incubation. Enzyme retained almost 100% and 50% of its activity in presence of 7% (w/v) of NaCl and 10% (w/v) of NaCl after 48h incubation (Fig. 8a). Though, enzyme retained almost 50% of its activity in presence of 14% (w/v) of NaCl after 6h incubation but there was drastic decrease in activity after 48h incubation. Similar behaviour has been reported for bacteria belonging to genus Bacillus [5,24]. But this is probably the first report on moderately salt tolerant amylase from marine Streptomyces sp. The amylase enzyme was found to be stable in buffer systems having pH 7–8 (phosphate buffer) to pH 9–11 (glycine–NaOH buffer) when incubated for 6–48h. There are various papers dealing with amylase having stability over wide range of pH; but this is probably the first report of amylase enzyme from haloalkaliphilic marine Streptomyces strain having wide range of pH stability (Fig. 8b). Therefore, enzymes may have widespread application for detergent industry [24]. Amylase activity decreased drastically at higher temperature such as 80 and 90°C (Fig. 9a) but there was drastic increase in stability (Fig. 9b) of enzyme in presence of calcium ion (10mM) especially at higher temperature as mentioned above.", "id": 1002, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Natronorubrum bangense?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "61858+Natronorubrum bangense"}

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Currently, seven species have been described in this genus: Azospirillum brasilense, A. lipoferum, A. amazonense, A. irakense, A. halopraeferens, A. largimobile, and A. doebereinerae (Hartmann and Baldani, 2003). The species A. brasilense, A. lipoferum, A. halopraeferens, A. largimobile and A. döebereinerae form one subcluster within the Azospirillum–Skermanella–Rhodocista cluster (Eckert et al., 2001; Stoffels et al., 2001), while A. amazonense and A. irakense form part of another subcluster. Despite the large number of species within this genus, most of the studies concerning host plant effects and genetic diversity of Azospirillum have focused on strains of A. lipoferum and A. brasilense (reviewed by Kennedy et al., 2004). Early phenotypic characterisations of strains isolated from C3 and C4 plants grown in pots or field conditions indicated that C4 plants were preferentially colonised by A. lipoferum while C3 plants were colonised by A. brasilense, suggesting that the host plants could exert a selective effect on the root colonisation of graminaceous plants by these bacteria (Baldani and Döbereiner, 1980). Differences in C4 and C3 photosynthetic pathways could be responsible for the preferential bacterial colonisation as observed in the above study. In tropical countries, as in Brazil, most cultivated grasses are C4 plants, with the exception of the C3 plants rice and wheat (Heckathorn et al., 1999). Plants with the C4 pathway are known to produce unique 4-carbon photosynthetic metabolic intermediates (i.e. malate and oxaloacetate). In the tropics, with adequate water, they can maximise the advantages of full sunlight and high temperatures resulting in increased yields of fixed carbon. In contrast, C3 plants are more adapted to temperate climates. At temperatures above 25°C, C3 plants metabolise more carbohydrate than is produced by photosynthesis, resulting in net loss of carbon through photorespiration and a high diversity of carbon-containing exudates into the rhizosphere soil. The hypothesis that differences in carbon exudates could be responsible for the specificity of A. brasilense to C3 and A. lipoferum to C4 plants was tested by measuring their chemotactic responses to several organic compounds normally present in the rhizosphere, such as amino acids, sugars and organic acids (Reinhold et al., 1985). The authors observed that the chemotactic responses among isolates from two C4 plants were different from that observed of isolates from C3 plants. In contrast, Fedi et al. (1992), using exudates released by the roots, suggested that chemotaxis was a general rather than a host plant-specific response. Moreover, studies of the incidence of plant infection suggested that Azospirillum species do not have any preference for any particular plant species, but that the plant–Azospirillum interaction is a rather active process involving bacterial motility towards root infection sites and the balance between attractive or repelling substances released by the roots (Bashan and Holguin, 1997). In addition, Azospirillum strain specificity to host plant or soil type has been inferred from the absence of antigenic similarity among Azospirillum strains isolated from the roots of different types of plants (De-Polli et al., 1980; Annapurna and Gaur, 1998; Reis et al., 2004). Clear differences in the ability of Azospirillum strains to promote growth, colonisation or contribution to fixed N incorporation in plant and soil systems have been reported (reviewed by Steenhoudt and Vanderleyden, 2000; Bashan et al., 2004). In spite of a great deal of information about colonisation of plants by strains of A. lipoferum and A. brasilense, very little is known about the influence of soil or host plant specificity on genetic diversity of A. amazonense populations. A. amazonense are Gram-negative bacteria, slightly curved in shape, 0.8–1.0μm in diameter, and motile in liquid media by a single polar flagellum. Optimum growth temperature is 35°C, and pH range varies from 5.5 to 6.5. They grow well on glucose and sucrose but not on mannitol and glycerol.

The present study addressed the genus Marichromatium in which all strains except the type strain M. bheemlicum JA124T shared >99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Therefore, they constituted what has been described as a microdiverse ribotype (i.e., a cluster with less than 1% sequence divergence) [1]. In this context, we carried out a multi-gene based phylogenetic analysis. This was even more important since among the examined Marichromatium strains remarkable phenotypic differences were only found for a newly reported strain of M. gracile biotype thermosulfidiphilum DSM 21765 [33].

Similar behavior has been observed in other “new” locations for Cochlodinium blooms as well: Gárate-Lizárraga et al.

We suggest that the initial introduction of the organism to a region may be the result of onshore transport; maintenance of that organism in the newly established region is then consistent with the formation of either a seed bed or pelagic seed bank, which allows Cochlodinium to reappear seasonally and to persist for months at a time (Kim, 1998; Morales-Blake et al., 2001; Gárate-Lizárraga et al., 2004; Vargas-Montero et al., 2004). 4.2 Ecophysiological characteristics of Cochlodinium 4.2.1 Temperature and salinity Despite the large number of recorded blooms, there is a scarcity of data on the physiological response of Cochlodinium to such basic factors as temperature, salinity, and light.

This euryarchaeon is a hyperthermophilic archaeon with an optimal growth temperature of 88 °C which can fully withstand a 5.0 kGy dose of gamma irradiation without loss of viability [29], and thus is the most radioresistant archaeon to date. In reason of its extreme tolerance of extreme temperature and irradiation, it is very interesting to test whether DNA polymerases of T. gammatolerans have any specific features in comparison to other archaeal DNA pols. The genome of T. gammatolerans encodes two DNA pols, a family B DNA pol (Tga PolB) and family D DNA pol [29]. In this work, we cloned the Tga PolB gene, expressed its product and characterized its biochemical characteristics. The recombinant Tga PolB was found capable of bypassing uracil in a template DNA, which is distinct from other family B archaeal DNA pols. Furthermore, biochemical characterization of Tga PolB is discussed. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Materials were purchased from the following companies: pET-30a (+), Novagen (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); Plasmid Extraction Kit, PCR Cycle Pure Kit, and Gel Extraction Kit, Omega (Guangzhou, China); Escherichia coli DH5α cells, Transgene (Beijing, China); dNTPs, T4 DNA ligase, NdeI, XhoI, and Pfu DNA pol, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA); Chemicals, Amresco (WA, USA). 2.2 DNA substrates All the oligonucleotides used were synthesized by Sangon Company (Shanghai, China) and their sequences are listed in Table 1 . Primed DNA substrates were prepared by annealing the Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide with its complementary oligonucleotides in an annealing buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl. The annealing reactions were performed at 100 °C for 5 min and cooled slowly to room temperature at least 4 h. 2.3 Cloning of the Tga PolB encoding gene The TGAM_RS07365 gene encoding a family B DNA pol of T. gammatolerans was amplified by Pfu DNA pol using the genomic DNA as the template in the presence of the forward primer (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGC ATTCTCGATACCGACTACATC-3′, the italic nucleotides represent NdeI restriction site) and the reverse primer (5′- CCG CTC GAG TCA CTT CTT CCC TTT CAC CTT CAG-3′, the italic nucleotides represent XhoI restriction site). The PCR product was extracted and cleaved by NdeI and XhoI, and cloned into a pET-30a (+) vector. The sequence of the recombinant plasmid was verified by sequencing, and the confirmed plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIL cells for expressing Tga PolB protein with a 6 × His-tag in its C-terminal. 2.4 Overexpression and purification of Tga PolB For Tga PolB protein expression, the transformant was cultured at 37oC in LB medium containing 10 μg/mL kanamycin and 17 μg/mL chloramphenicol until the OD600 reached 0.6.", "id": 995, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermococcus zilligii?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "54076+Thermococcus zilligii"}

Keywords Geobacillus jurassicus sp. nov. Thermophile Taxonomy 16S rDNA Sequence DNA–DNA hybridization Fatty acids Introduction Over the past decade, geothermally heated petroleum reservoirs with a temperature of 60–85°C or higher have attracted the great interest of researchers as promising biotopes for the isolation of new thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms [6,19,37]. It is known that petroleum reservoirs are anaerobic environments dominated by anaerobic microorganisms. The anaerobic microorganisms isolated from high-temperature oilfields include representatives of various physiological groups of microorganisms, such as sulphate-, sulphur-, thiosulphate-, manganese- and iron-reducers, as well as fermentative, acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria [19]. However, aerobic microorganisms can also be found in oilfields, into which they come with injection waters, drilling solutions or, probably, due to the natural hydrodynamics of subsurface waters. Injection waters often contain dissolved oxygen, due to which the near-bottom zone of injection wells may become favourable to the growth of aerobic bacteria. Hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria are the important components of the aerobic–anaerobic microbial trophic chains that are resulted from petroleum transformation. Such bacteria were isolated from the oilfields and other subsurface horizons with temperatures from 20 to 70°C [5–6,22–24,33,35].", "id": 659, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Geobacillus stearothermophilus?", "synonym_description": "Geobacillus stearothermophilus is also known as G. stearothermophilus.

Operation parameters, such as the reactor dimensions, compost and cooling air properties as well as reactor heat transfer area and coefficients are based mainly on the compost properties and reactor design characteristics. Temperature profiles in the cooling phase of the reactor (final stage without reaction) were used to adjust the heat transfer coefficient. Kinetic parameters, such as the Arrhenius parameters necessary to calculate the maximum growth of each pseudo-family, were adjusted to reproduce the microbial behavior of each pseudo-family as reported in the literature. A sensitivity analysis was initially carried out to determine which parameters contribute with the largest effect on the growth and death rates for each specific biomass category using the parameter values reported by Seki (2002) as a starting point. Parameters a1, b1 and the reaction enthalpies exhibited the largest influence on the biomass behavior. These three parameters were adjusted to reproduce the specific optimal growth and maximum death temperatures of each one of the microbial categories as described previously: actinomycetes involved in A. bisporus composting grow optimally at 50 to 55 C with the highest death rates at 65 to 70 C; thermophilics exhibit their optimal grow temperature between 46 and 48 C and die at temperatures ranging from 58 to 63 C; mesophilic bacteria and fungi grow mostly at temperatures below 40 C and die almost completely at temperatures higher than 50 C.

The occurrence of Shewanella species in the invertebrates studied varied significantly. For example, in two different species of holothurian, the proportion of Shewanella species ranged from 6.7% to 20.8%. Only one strain (4.2% of all bacteria isolated from the sample) belonging to the genus Shewanella, was identified from the microbial population of an ophiuroid.

It should be emphasized that rather high proportion of Shewanella species obtained may be ex- plained by so called “the great plate count anomaly” [43], a well-studied phenomenon of difference in orders of magnitude between numbers of cells from natural en- vironments that form colonies (often fast growing bacte- ria) and numbers countable by microscopic examination [23]. Moreover, there is a substantial discrepancy be- tween 16S rDNA genes recovered by cloning and those of the readily culturable marine taxa [11, 12, 25, 44]. For instance, according to culture-independant 16S rRNA- based techniques, “Gammaproteobactera” constitute less than 1% of total cells counts [11]. Noteworthly, the pro- portion of cultivable Shewanella species may vary signifi- cantly depending on specific econiche or conditions of isolation. For example, it was reported recently that among dominating denitrifying “Gammaproteobacteria” (96% of the total strains), Shewanella isolates recovered from water column in the estuarine ecosystem of the Baltic Sea were the most abundant (77%). Dos Santos et al. [10] noted that “S. massilia” accounted up to 45% of total cultivable bacteria isolated from decayed fish Mul- lus surmuletus. All seventy selected presumptive Shewanella strains were analysed and grouped according to biochemical tests, while further representative strains of different phe- notypes were selected for subsequent fatty acid analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing. All strains formed circular, smooth and convex colonies with entire edge. They were slightly pinkish or slightly greenish (one phenotype), 3–5 mm in diameter after 2–4 days of incubation at room temperature (ca. 22–24C).", "id": 969, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Shewanella benthica?", "synonym_description": "Shewanella benthica is also known as S. benthica.

The complete enzymatic degradation of cellulose generally requires three types of cellulolytic enzymes (Krogh et al., 2009): (1) endoglucanases, which cleave cellulose internal β-1,4-glucosidic bonds to produce new chain ends; (2) exocellobiohydrolases, which cut the non-reducing end of the cellulose polymer chain to release the disaccharide cellobiose; and (3) β-glucosidases, which hydrolyse cellobiose and other short cello-oligosaccharides to form glucose. β-glucosidases play a pivotal role in the biodegradation of cellulosic materials. β-glucosidases have been widely applied in bioenergy conversion, textile, pulp and paper, waste treatment, fruit juice extraction, consolidated bioprocess and isoflavone bioconversion in food and animal feed industries (Bhat, 2000; Chang et al., 2013; Ghosh et al., 1982; Shipkowski and Brenchley, 2005).

Keywords Aquificota Persephonella hydrothermal chemolithoautotroph temperature thermophile Introduction Hydrothermal chimneys are mineral structures resulting from the precipitation of various chemical species during the mixing between the hot, reduced hydrothermal fluid and the cold, oxygenated seawater [31,34]. These structures and the surrounding seawater are characterized by steep gradients: (1) chemical gradients due to the mixing of reduced compounds (e.g. H2, CH4, H2S, S2O3 2-, Fe2+) from the hydrothermal fluid, and oxidised compounds from the surrounding seawater (e.g. O2, NO3 -, SO4 2-); and (2) thermal gradients decreasing from the inner parts of chimneys heated by hydrothermal fluid circulation (> 300°C), to the external parts in contact with seawater (2-4°C) [45,51]. These gradients cause a chemical disequilibrium that supports chemoautotrophic microorganisms that oxidise reduced compounds from hydrothermal fluid using oxidised species from seawater. Hence, adaptation of these microorganisms to the thermal and chemical gradients shapes their spatial distribution across hydrothermal habitats [10,11,51,74]. For example, dissolved oxygen concentrations are inversely correlated with temperature and usually separate aerobic mesophiles from anaerobic hyperthermophiles [1,41,45,46]. At temperatures exceeding 80°C, a majority of microorganisms in these environments seem to have specifically adapted to conditions that are present only at small spatial scales in the hydrothermal chimney (e.g. Methanococcales, Thermococcales) [11,45].", "id": 652, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Persephonella atlantica?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2699429+Persephonella atlantica"}

Whereas bacterial NDTs are homohexamers endowed with dihedral D3 molecular symmetry [10], eukaryotic NDTs are homodimers [10]. The basic catalytic unit [12] of all these enzymes is a dimeric assembly where each active site is configured by residues contributed by both polypeptide chains that despite sharing a low level of sequence identity between them their 3D structure is highly conserved. In fact, we reported only minor changes between the architectures of the subunits from dimeric and hexameric NDTs [10]. With the exception of BpNDT, which is produced by the psychrotolerant bacterium B. psychrosaccharolyticus, the other NDTs with known 3D structure described up to now are mesophilic enzymes. In this regard, we found that BpNDT behaves as a mesophilic enzyme with an optimal temperature for activity of 50 °C [7], well above the maximum temperature for bacterial growth (30 °C). Shorter, flexible loops around the active site of BpNDT than in LhPDT and LlNDT suggested a mechanism of adaptation to low temperatures [7]; however, all these NDTs are characterized by an irregular region situated at the entrance of the active site which is highly flexible and usually poorly defined [7,10–13].

It is unfortunate that there is no culture available of Pernina chaumonti because this marine species has some morphological features in common with our amoeba (El Kadiri et al. 1992).

After separation from rNMPs using boronate column chromatography, dNMPs were phosphorylated to yield dNTPs by using pyruvate kinase, myokinase, guanylate kinase and the kinasing fraction of E. coli. This procedure was followed by Smith et al. [29], who cultivated E. coli MY285 on 13C-glucose and 15NH4Cl M9 minimal media, but improved dNTP synthesis by using NMP kinase instead of the kinasing fraction of E. coli and a GST-fusion of dTMP kinase for efficient phosphorylation of dCMP and dTMP, respectively. Masse et al. [30] applied this phosphorylation strategy and additionally separated the four dNTPs by preparative reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC. Werner et al. [31] described the high cell density growth of 13C, 15N-labeled E. coli BL21 in a controlled fermenter and a HPLC purification strategy of the individual dNMPs and additionally used recombinant dCMP kinase to specifically phosphorylate dCMP. Uniform 13C-labeling of nucleotides in E. coli has also been accomplished by using 13C2-acetate [32,33] as the carbon source. Hoffman and Holland [32] further demonstrated that by growing E. coli on 1-13C-acetate >90% of the purines C4 and C6 and >95% of the pyrimidines C2 and C4 contained a 13C-label whereas the other ring carbons were less than 5% 13C-labeled.

These DNA G+C content values are consistent with that of the genus Chryseobacterium [35]. The CFA profile of strain 701B-08T was compared with the type strain of the most closely related Cryseobacterium species, i.e., as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence comparative analyses (Table 1).

Comparisons of the RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) gene additionally indicated that all four strains from this study comprised a cluster distinct from other characterized species with the closest relative being Acidovorax sp. JHL-3 (Appendix Fig. A.1). Characterization Isolated Acidovorax strains grew well on common, complex growth media including NA and R2A with colonies generally appearing within 24–48h. Colonies on NA plates grown for 48h for each of the strains were pale yellow to yellow in color (cream to pale yellow on R2A plates), circular and convex with entire margins, and up to 1.0–1.5mm in diameter. Addition of indole to plates resulted in purple colonies for each strain, indicating the probable production of indigo from an active aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase that catalyzes the initial step of aerobic bacterial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation [17]. Growth was observed for all four stains at temperatures tested between 15°C and 35°C, with optimal growth at 30–32.5°C for all strains. Weak growth was observed after two weeks of incubation at 4°C, 37°C, and 40°C in regions of the plates with the densest inoculum for all strains but P4, which did not grow at 40°C. All strains grew at pH 6.0–8.0, with optimal growth at either 7.0 or 7.5. In addition, strain NA3T grew weakly at pH 5.5 and strains P3 and P4 at pH 8.5. All strains grew optimally without amended salt but could tolerate 1% NaCl; no growth was observed after 24h in media supplemented with 2–5% NaCl. No growth was observed under anaerobic conditions on the media tested. All subsequent tests were generally conducted in media at a pH of 7.5, a temperature of 30 or 32.5°C, and with no amended salt. Under scanning electron microscopy, all four strains were observed to be slightly-curved or straight rods without distinguishing external features (Fig. 2 ). The cell sizes ranged from 0.9–2.1×0.4–0.5μm (P3), 0.8–1.6×0.4–0.6μm (P4), 0.8–1.5×0.3–0.5μm (NA2), and 0.9–1.9×0.4–0.5μm (NA3T), with average cell sizes (n=100) of 1.4×0.5μm (P3), 1.1×0.4μm (P4), 1.1×0.4μm (NA2), and 1.2×0.4μm (NA3T). No flagella were evident in scanning electron micrographs despite the fact that Acidovorax isolates typically exhibit one to three polar flagella [62] and the genomic sequences of these four strains indicated the presence of genes for flagellar synthesis. To examine this apparent discrepancy, each strain was inoculated into motility agar stabs and examined after several days of growth. A feathering of growth radiating from each stab indicated motility for all strains. Single, polar flagella were subsequently detected on cells extracted from those stabs (Appendix Fig. A.2). The lack of flagella in electron micrographs was attributed to physical shearing during sample preparation and/or growth conditions within the preparative media. The dominant fatty acids of the four strains were identified as summed feature 3 which included C16:1ω7c and C16:1ω6c (47–48%), C16:0 (26–29%), and C18:1ω7c (12–16%) (Table 1 ). Based on the profiles of other Acidovorax strains the summed feature was likely to be predominantly C16:1ω7c. Minor fatty acids included C10:0 3-OH, C12:0, and C14:0. In addition to 3-hydroxydecanoic acid (C10:0 3-OH), cells from all strains also contained trace amounts of 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (C8:-0 3-OH), both of which are markers for the Acidovorax genus [62]. The fatty acid profiles of these strains were consistent with the genus. Major polar lipids in NA3T were phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and two other lipids. The sole detected respiratory quinone in NA3T was Q8 (100%). Each of the four strains was catalase negative and oxidase positive.

A sulfate-reducing bacterium isolated from a creek sediment and capable of metabolizing TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) using sulfate and nitrate as electron acceptors was tentatively characterized as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain A. The isolate was unable to use TNT as the sole source of carbon. TNT degradation was accomplished by a co-metabolic process using pyruvate as the main substrate. Two different metabolic steps were employed by this isolate under different electron-accepting conditions. Under sulfate-reducing conditions, TNT was reduced to 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene and 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene. In contrast, under nitrate-reducing conditions, these amino compounds were not produced, instead, butyric acid was identified as the major metabolite of TNT metabolism. This organism also used a wide variety of other carbon sources, including ethanol, lactate, succinate, formate and malate. The isolate contained the electron-carrier desulfoviridin and used sulfate, nitrate, and thiosulfate as electron acceptors. The isolate had an optimal temperature of 25°C and an optimal pH of 6.8 and used ammonium chloride, nitrate and glutamate as nitrogen sources. The characteristic features of the sulfate-reducing bacterium closely resembled those of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.", "id": 806, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Desulfobulbus propionicus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "894+Desulfobulbus propionicus"}

The temperature optimum was 35°C, with 15% of maximum activity observed at 0°C. This is rather typical for other psychrophilic enzymes [28], but unusual for other widely utilised lipases that are of meso- and thermophilic origin, which exhibit only trace activity at this temperature [29]. Interestingly, LipG7 also showed extreme thermostability, retaining 100% carboxyl esterase activity following 1h incubation at 100°C; a typical method for assaying thermostability. The observed activity versus temperature characteristic of LipG7 (Fig. 3) is typical of other cold-adapted lipases [30,31], but the results of the thermostability assay are unique. Most known cold-adapted lipases lose their activity after 1h at 50°C [31–35] or at even lower denaturing temperatures [36,37]. Only a few have been reported to retain their residual activity after incubation above 50°C [38,39], including the recently reported esterase from Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5(T) that retains 60% activity after 1h incubation at the substantially lower denaturing temperature of 80°C [40].", "id": 1311, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Psychrobacter cryohalolentis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "330922+Psychrobacter cryohalolentis"}

Fenollar, Aix-Marseille Université, URMITE, UM63, CNRS 7278, IRD 198, Inserm U1095, Faculté de médecine, 27 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France Strain FF9T was isolated in Dakar (Senegal) from a blood-culture taken from a 16-month-old child. MALDI-TOF analysis did not allow for identification. After sequencing, strain FF9T exhibited 98.18% similarity with the 16SrRNA sequence of Paenibacillus uliginis. A polyphasic study of phenotypic and genomic analyses showed that strain FF9T is Gram variable, catalase-positive, and presents a genome of 4,569,428 bp (one chromosome but no plasmid) with 4,427genes (4,352 protein-coding and 75 RNA genes (including 3 rRNA operons). The G+C content is 45.7%. On the basis of these genomic and phenotypic data analyses, we propose the creation of Paenibacillus dakarensis strain FF9T. Keywords Culturomics genome Paenibacillus dakarensis taxono-genomics Introduction Paenibacillus species were originally classified within the Bacillus genus [1]. Members of this genus are often Gram variable, facultatively anaerobic, and endospore forming.", "id": 1161, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Paenibacillus borealis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "160799+Paenibacillus borealis"}
