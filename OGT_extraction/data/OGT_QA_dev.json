Recent investigations recorded a high biodiversity of Chaetothyriales associated with ants (Voglmayr et al. 2011; Nepel et al. 2014), which is assumed to be linked to physiology of both ants and fungi. Ants produce a huge diversity of organic, including aromatic, compounds in their glands which have antibacterial and antifungal properties. Due to their abilities to tolerate and metabolize these toxic substances, Chaetothyriales are highly pre-adapted to occupy various niches within ant nests which cannot be used by other fungal competitors.

Cellulolytic activity was also detected in culture supernatants. These enzymes exhibited different behaviors with respect to growth temperature. PLII was not regulated by temperature, whereas PLI and PLIII were regulated similarly by growth temperature. Maximal levels of PLI and PLIII were produced at 14°C when cells were grown in polygalacturonate-containing synthetic medium and at around 20 to 24°C in nutrient broth. In contrast, thermoregulation of cellulolytic activity production differed from thermoregulation of PL.

These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5].

However, the ability to use only two amino acids, namely alanine and glycine (weak growth), as a source of carbon and energy is a much rarer phenomenon. To our surprise strain S-94T did not even grow on casamino acids or a mixture of all natural amino acids as a source of carbon, energy and nitrogen. Moreover, casamino acids and the amino acid mixture of Hudson et al. [15] promoted the growth of the organism on citrate and succinate in the minimal medium without ammonium salts, appearing therefore, to serve as a source of nitrogen. We initially thought that casamino acids could contain ammonium salts from the spontaneous breakdown of amino acids or nitrogenous organic compounds that served as nitrogen source for growth of the organism in the presence of organic acids. However, the filter-sterilized amino acid mixture of Hudson et al. [15] also promoted the growth of the organism in the minimal medium containing succinate or citrate and presumably did not contain large amounts of breakdown products. It turned out that the casamino acids and the amino acid mixture [15] contained only very low concentrations of alanine, and even lower levels of glycine, that could not support visible growth. It is, however, difficult to explain the promotion of growth on succinate and citrate by proline, glutamate and glutamine, none of which serve as sole source of carbon, energy and nitrogen. We speculate that amino acids are taken up very slowly by transport systems, while organic acids are rapidly taken up. The low rates of amino acid uptake could provide enough ammonia for biosynthesis and growth of the organism on organic acids, but would not provide enough carbon and energy to promote growth within the time used to assess carbon source assimilation.

However, this bacterium weakly ferments casamino acids, peptone, betaine, xylan, galacatose, and mannose, and grows at the optimal temperature and pH of 37 °C and 6.0–7.2, respectively (Guo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018a; Yamada et al., 2006). Rhizobium cellulosilyticum belongs to the family Rhizobiaceae and phylum Proteobacteria, which utilizes substrates such as arabinose, glucose, glutamic acid, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, mannose, and N-acetyl glucosamine as carbon sources in the degradation of wood. It grows at the optimal temperature and pH of 28 °C and 7.0–7.5, respectively (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2007). Hydrogenispora ethanolica belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that utilizes various substrates such as tryptone, fumarate, glycerol, starch, pectin, raffinose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, ribose, xylose, fructose, arabinose, maltose, and glucose. The main fermentation products are acetate, ethanol, and H2. It grows at the optimal temperature range of 37–45 °C and pH range of 6.0–7.7 (Liu et al., 2014).", "id": 631, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Levilinea saccharolytica?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "229921+Levilinea saccharolytica"}

The bacterium was first grown in synthetic medium to determine optimal growth conditions using the combination of the Plackett–Burman and Box–Behnken methods and consequently aflatoxin B1 in groundnut cake slurry was degraded under varying culture conditions. Optimal growth conditions were found as 22.5 °C of temperature, pH 7, 100 mL of culture volume in 500 mL flasks, 1 % (v/v) of inoculum size, 135 rpm of agitation speed, 5 g/L of glucose and 5 g/L of peptone concentration according to analysis of the Box–Behnken design. Optimal detoxification conditions were found as 27.4 % (w/v) of solid concentration, 4.88 % (v/v) of inoculum size and 24 h of incubation time by Box–Behnken response surface optimization. Maximum detoxification level was predicted as 92.2 % by the constructed model while the experimental counterpart was 87.3 %. The suggested culture conditions have the potential to decrease aflatoxin B1 from 200 μg/kg to below 20 μg/kg, the regulatory limit, in feed materials. Further studies are needed to test the obtained results at a larger scale and to finalize safety assessment of the final product by animal testing.

F. branchiophilum and F. columnare are also to clinical relevant bacterial fish pathogens that can be differentiated from the new species on the basis of their failure to grow in trypticase-soy and nutrient agars and to hydrolyze aesculine. Two new species, Flavobacterium chilense sp. nov., and Flavobacterium araucananum sp. nov., have been recently isolated from farmed diseased rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon in Chile [15]. The isolates of F. oncorhynchi can readily be differentiated from both species because they are motile (gliding), grow in 3% NaCl, assimilate mannitol and hydrolyze gelatine, while F. oncorhynchi gives opposite results. In addition, this species can also be differentiated from F. chilense by the ability of the latter species to hydrolyze casein, produce acid from l-arabinose and assimilate gluconate and malate. Moreover, differences were also observed in the composition of polar lipids. Phosphatidylserine was one of the major polar lipids observed in F. chilense and F. araucananum but it was not detected from the extract from strain 631-08T of F. oncorhynchi. Visual comparison of the restriction endonuclease digestion profiles generated by PFGE, revealed 7 different profiles (represented by isolates 441B-08, 688B-08, 666-09, 631-08T, 646-08, 47B-2-09 and 425B-08) among the 18 trout isolates (Fig. 3 ). Most isolates were closely related and exhibited genetic similarities ≥80% supporting that they are members of a single species. Some isolates with identical PFGE profile were repeatedly isolated from different diseased trout on different times, data that could be indicative of their clinical significance. Nevertheless the virulence of the new isolates has not been determined yet by challenge experiments. In conclusion, it is clear from the results of this study conducted using a polyphasic taxonomic approach, that the unidentified isolates from rainbow trout constitute a new species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium oncorhynchi sp. nov. is proposed.

The resting cyst is considered as an adaptation to survive during unfavorable environmental conditions (Fryxell, 1983), including suboptimal abiotic growth conditions (e.g. Anderson et al., 1983), as well as predators and parasites (Rengefors et al., 1998; Hansson, 1996; Toth et al., 2004). Our germination studies show that Gonyostomum cysts can germinate at all temperatures above zero after a mandatory dormancy period, but that the germination rate increased at higher temperatures. The data also show a phenotypic variation among cysts, in that only a small proportion of the cysts germinate at low temperatures (20% germinate below 6°C). This means that an earlier warming of the water in the spring could increase the length of the Gonyostomum growth season. However, we observed maximum germination (in percent) in May, after seven months storage in the cold and dark, indicating the presence of an endogenous clock partly regulating germination. The month of May corresponds to when cells are usually first observed in the field in Southern Sweden (Lebret et al., in press) and is one of the months with most frequent occurrence of Gonyostomum in the monitoring data. The temperature growth experiments clearly indicate that growth does not occur below 6°C, and that optimum temperatures for the growth of Gonyostomum lie between 9 and 12°C (Fig. 4), at least in the strains tested. Since surface water temperatures during summer frequently exceed 10°C, most pronounced changes in the Gonyostomum biomass in a warmer climate are expected to occur during spring and autumn. This expectation was fulfilled by our results showing most prominent changes in the Gonyostomum biomass in October. Growth was still positive at temperatures above 12°C in the laboratory, indicating that Gonyostomum grows at higher water temperatures as well.", "id": 1327, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Gonyostomum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "375453+Gonyostomum"}

The optimum growth temperatures of isolates of P. cinnamomi, P. gonapodyides, P. quercina and P. psychrophila were 20-23, 23-26, 20-23 and 20°C, respectively. At 17 and 20°C, all four Phytophthora species caused 100% acorn mortality, whereas at 26°C, acorn mortality was 100, 10, 25 and 0% in P. cinnamomi, P. gonapodyides, P. quercina and P. psychrophila infested soils, respectively. At 23°C, P. cinnamomi and P. gonapodyides reduced acorn radicle length more than P. quercina and P. psychrophila, whereas at 26°C, only P. cinnamomi caused further reduction in radicle length. The higher susceptibility of germinating acorns in comparison to seedlings reported in the literature indicates age-related susceptibility of Q. ilex to Phytophthora. The seedling/pathogen growth ratio was inversely related to the reduction in radicle length at different temperatures (Radj2 = 0.84, p < 0.0001), suggesting that rapid germination may allow seedlings to escape from infection. Increasing temperatures had different effects on damage to acorns depending on the pathogen present in the soil, indicating that Phytophthora species × temperature interactions determined Q. ilex germination.

We investigated the interplay between the sporulation temperature and the CotE morphogenetic protein in the assembly of the surface layers of B. cereus ATCC 14579 spores and on the resulting spore properties. The cotE deletion affects the coat and exosporium composition of the spores formed both at the suboptimal temperature of 20°C and at the optimal growth temperature of 37°C. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ΔcotE spores had a fragmented and detached exosporium when formed at 37°C. However, when produced at 20°C, ΔcotE spores showed defects in both coat and exosporium attachment and were susceptible to lysozyme and mutanolysin. Thus, CotE has a role in the assembly of both the coat and exosporium, which is more important during sporulation at 20°C.

However, maintaining high levels of PMF becomes increasingly difficult for the bacteria living in alkaline environments, where the external concentration of H+ ions is low [1,3–6]. To reconcile the life at alkaline pH values with the chemiosmotic principle, Skulachev proposed that alkaliphilic bacteria could use Na+ as a coupling ion instead of or in addition to H+ and coined the term “Sodium World” [1]. Another reason for a switch from H+ to Na+ was suggested by Konings and co-workers, who observed a rapid increase of proton leakage through the membrane at elevated temperatures [7] and reasoned that hyperthermophilic bacteria would benefit from relying on the sodium-motive force (SMF) instead of PMF [8,9]. Similarly to the H+ cycle, the Na+ cycle would include generators of SMF (primary Na+ pumps) and SMF consumers, such as Na+-translocating membrane ATP synthase, Na+-dependent membrane transporters for nutrient uptake and/or a Na+-dependent flagellar motor for motility. The idea that SMF might substitute for PMF has been verified by studies of such anaerobic bacteria as Propionigenium modestum, Malonomonas rubra, and Clostridium (renamed Caloramator) fervidus, which rely exclusively on Na+ ions for their energy metabolism [10–12].

The draft genome also contains a KatA and a KatE gene encoding for enzymes associated with protection against reactive oxygen species [55], as well as a sox gene cluster and several genes coding for betaine biosynthesis and for betaine and choline uptake, all of these genes are involved in responses to oxidative stress [6,7,52]. In turn, the presence of a carbon storage regulator gene (Csr) (fig|6666666.388060.peg.4837) is associated with multiple biosynthetic pathways, including glycogen biosynthesis [64,65]. Two copies of an uvrD gene encode ATP dependent DNA helicase were detected; these genes are involved in the UV-resistance of M. italicus BC 501T (formerly M. marinus) [55]. Genes linked with responses to desiccation stress were not found though multiple copies of genes involved in the uptake of trehalose and associated with tolerance to desiccation and temperature in bacteria [62] were detected. Similarly, genes linked with stabilizing genomes, namely recO, recF and recQ helicase [25,41], were found. Two copies of coxD, coxE and coxG genes and a coxLSM cluster which encode for different subunits of carbon monoxide (CO) dehydrogenase were highlighted in a BLAST search of the 1G6T genome; these genes encode for the uptake of carbon monoxide indicating that this isolate may have a chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle [39]. Similar profile of stress-related genes have been detected in the genomes of the type strains of Blastococcus atacamensis [11], G. chilensis [12] and M. caceresii [10], all of which were isolated from Atacama Desert soils. Biosynthetic gene clusters Mining of the draft genome of isolate 1G6T using the antiSMASH server [4] revealed the presence of several putative biosynthetic gene clusters. Two of the clusters coded for type 2 and type 3 polyketide synthases while others were associated with the synthesis of betalactone and terpenes; these results are in line with corresponding studies on the type strains of G. chilensis [12] and M. caceresii [10]. However, improved genome alignments are needed to achieve a better understanding of the genomes of isolate 1G6T and those of the type strains of G. chilensis and M. caceresii. Conclusions The chemotaxonomic, cultural, morphological and phenotypic data show that isolates 1G6T, 1G14 and 1G50 are not clones but are bone fide members of the genus Modestobacter and belong to the same species. The isolates can be separated readily from the type strains of Modestobacter species by a wealth of genomic and phenotypic data. In addition, isolate 1G6T can be distinguished from M. italicus BC 501T, its closest phylogenetic neighbour, by low ANI and dDDH values. Consequently, it is proposed that the three isolates be recognised as a novel species of Modestobacter, namely as Modestobacter excelsi. It is also interesting that the genome of isolate 1G6T is rich in stress-related genes associated with cold and heat stress responses, oxidative stress, resistance to UV-radiation and with an ability to use carbon monoxide as a source of carbon and energy while the presence of a few natural product biosynthetic gene clusters show that it has the capacity to produce specialized metabolites; these observations provide support for the view that the competitive success of Geodermatophilaceae strains in extreme, sparsely populated biomes may be more related to stress resistance than to antibiosis [8].

This value is higher than those (14–16 kcal/mol) of the light-intensity sensors previously reported for the other CBCR lineage (33, 35). The higher activation energy means that AM1_1870g4 possesses higher thermosensitivity than the other light-intensity sensors.

All these aspects of pH variation are reflected in fungal diversity and distribution of species succession in wood, where a knowledge of this is critically important to enable the operator to maximise spalting potential. The ability to manipulate fungal reactions through moisture content and pH changes in wood may offer a chance to enhance the pigmentation intensity and patterns currently available with spalted woods. However, as a number of decay fungi (e.g. Armillaria spp., Trametes spp.) have the ability to adjust their own pH and moisture content to favour their growth and nutrient assimilation, this makes these parameters difficult to control when producing zone lines [14,28,38,39,70]. Along with pH and wood moisture content, species of wood decay-fungi vary in temperature optima [26], which should be considered during the incubation process. Water activity tests (aw, 0–1; the relative vapour pressure of a substrate) enable us to discover which species work best at a given temperature or even strains within a species where small temperature differences can help determine the success of zone-line formation. For instance, Fomes fomentarius (Fig. 2) has an optimum temperature from 27 to 30 °C, Armillaria mellea prefers it slightly lower at 25–26 °C while Trametes versicolor has a broader optimum range of 24–33 °C [62].", "id": 966, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Fomes fomentarius?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "40442+Fomes fomentarius"}

Spawn-burning has become the most serious problem for edible mushroom cultivated with bags in summer. It was thought that spawn-burning was caused by environmental high temperatures that directly damaged mycelia resulting in mycelial death. However, the mycelial metabolic activity increased the temperature of bags. It has been suggested that strain selection for resistance to high temperature might results in tolerance to spawn-burning. However, the mechanism of spawn-burning remained unclear. In this study, our results showed that the maximum growth temperature (38°C) and lethal temperature (41°C) of P. eryngii was far higher than spawn-burning temperature (34°C). Therefore, some other factors must be involved in spawn-burning. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of spawn-burning syndrome in P. eryngii growing in edible mushroom cultivation bags. On the one hand increased aerobic respiration of mycelia at high temperatures consumes more oxygen compared to medium temperatures (Pietikäinen et al., 2005; Prasad et al., 1979); on the other hand the oxygen solubility in water decreased at high temperatures. One possibility is that spawn-burning symptoms could be due to decreased dissolved oxygen content in the substrate at high temperature since the plastic bags film limits oxygen supply. If the level of oxygen in the substrate becomes inadequate, then the lack of oxygen and accumulation of carbon dioxide to the mycelia could result in spawn-burning. To test this hypothesis, analysis was done under spawn-burning conditions for the levels of the fermentation enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, EC 4.1.1.1), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27), the levels of the fermentation products ethanol, acetaldehyde and lactate, and the impact of these fermentation products on mycelial growth. The results showed that anaerobic respiration in cultivation substrate of mycelia was involved in spawn-burning. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Strain P. eryngii strain ACCC 52626, provided by the Agricultural Culture Collection of China (ACCC), was used in this study.

A. thiooxydans T is also a moderate osmophile, since growth in liquid media required an external osmotic potential of 2 bar, and was optimal at 5 bar. As a reference, typical culture medium for acidophiles has an osmotic potential of ∼2 bars when amended with 4 g/L ferrous iron sulfate. The addition of magnesium sulfate to 100 mM, increases it to ∼4.6 bars. This becomes critical in elemental sulfur amended cultures, where Acidiferrobacter strains do not grow well, unless magnesium sulfate is added. Under these conditions, a medium with 100 mM magnesium sulfate possess an osmotic potential of ∼2.8 bars. At the time of proposal of the Acidiferrobacter genus, it was allocated into the Ectothiorhodospiraceae family within the Gammaproteobacteria, order Chromatiales [1].

The main goal of this work was to determine the temperature-dependent changes in the virulence factors that could explain the virulence properties of V. anguillarum for fish cultivated at different temperatures. We have found that although the optimal growth temperature is around 25°C, the degree of virulence of V. anguillarum RV22 is higher at 15°C. To explain this result, an RNA-Seq analysis was performed to compare the whole transcriptome profile of V. anguillarum RV22 cultured under low-iron availability at either 25 or 15°C, which would mimic the conditions that V. anguillarum finds during colonization of fish cultivated at warm-or cold-water temperatures. The comparative analysis of transcriptomes at high-and low-iron conditions showed profound metabolic adaptations to grow under low iron. These changes were characterized by a down-regulation of the energetic metabolism and the induction of virulence-related factors like biosynthesis of LPS, production of hemolysins and lysozyme, membrane transport, heme uptake, or production of siderophores. However, the expression pattern of virulence factors under iron limitation showed interesting differences at warm and cold temperatures. Chemotaxis, motility, as well as the T6SS1 genes are expressed at higher levels at 25°C than at 15°C. By contrast, hemolysin RTX pore-forming toxin, T6SS2, and the genes associated with exopolysaccharides synthesis were preferentially expressed at 15°C. Notably, at this temperature, the siderophore piscibactin system was strongly up-regulated. In contrast, at 25°C, piscibactin genes were down-regulated and the vanchrobactin siderophore system seems to supply all the necessary iron to the cell. The results showed that V. anguillarum adjusts the expression of virulence factors responding to two environmental signals, iron levels and temperature. Thus, the relative relevance of each virulence factor for each fish species could vary depending on the water temperature. The results give clues about the physiological adaptations that allow V. anguillarum to cause infections in different fishes and could be relevant for vaccine development against fish vibriosis.", "id": 285, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Vibrio anguillarum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "55601+Vibrio anguillarum"}

Koeck and colleagues [37]. This thermophilic non-sporulating rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from a thermophilic biogas plant with an optimal growth at 55 °C. Nevertheless, whereas H. hemicellulosilytica T3/55T is registered in the SILVA database both in the data sets of aligned small (SSU) and large (LSU) subunits, at the time of writing, its affiliation according to the LSU database belonged to the genus Herbinix (Lachnospiraceae), while within the SSU database, it was affiliated to the genus Mobilitalea (Lachnospiraceae). Mobilitalea sibirica is absent in the LSU database, and only present in SSU dataset under a self-titled genus name Mobilitalea (Lachnospiraceae). Thus, such discrepancies within the known databases make the proper strain identification and determination of the microbial composition through metagenomic analysis quite sophisticated, particularly when the re-classification of the previously described species is an ongoing process. In the microbial community, the products of the lignocellulolose hydrolysis, such as soluble sugars, alcohol and organic acids, mainly short chain volatile fatty acids, are further metabolized into acetic acid, molecular hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The syntrophic microorganisms are also capable of acetate oxidation into these gaseous products, although only in the case of low H2 partial pressure. Since the free hydrogen should be constantly removed, the most efficient hydrogen utilization and bioconversion in the biogas community happens during the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. According to the HTS analysis, the majority of the methanogens in the tested community are represented by the hydrogenotrophic strains of Methanothermobacter (96%) and only 4% contributes to Methanosarcina, which is capable of using both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways for the methane production. Although the microorganisms, similar by their morphology to the filament-like cells of Methanosaeta, were detected by the light microscopy (Fig. S1), no traces of this acetotrophic methanogen were identified by DGGE or HTS analysis. Interestingly, but only one of the DGGE profiles of the archaeal community corresponded to the HTS results; the presence of Methanothermobacter and Methanosarcina strains were detected when the primer pairs of Arch338F-Arch1381R followed by Arch344F-GC-Arch915R were used, whereas the usage of Univ515F −Arch915R primers revealed an additional representative (according to the NCBI database) of Methanoculleus thermophilus that also performs a hydrogenotrophic type of methanogenesis. The selection of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens over aceticlastic methanogens under the extreme-thermophilic (70 °C) conditions was also shown by F.Zhang and colleagues [41] with the presence of mainly Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus and Methanobacterium thermoaggregans as 98% of Archaea. Although the acetate-oxidizing reactions are energetically unfavourable in comparison to the acetoclastic way of the acetate degradation [42], they were shown to be efficient during the waste-paper bioconversion into biomethane, due to the strong relations between the syntrophic acetate-oxydizing bacteria (SAOB) and methanogenic Archaea. SAOB are known to use H2/CO2 to produce acetate, as well as vice versa, to utilize acetate reversibly [42].

The X-ray structure of P. mob LDH is reported here and compared with the one of T. the to identify possible structural features explaining the activity profiles.

We finally consider the effect of temperature on the protein conformational states relevant for the enzyme functionality using MD simulations. 2 Results In order to facilitate comparison a dual numbering system was used for enzyme residues. It combines the linear numbering based on the primary sequence of each LDH with the normalized numbering for LDHs, useful for structural comparison (Eventoff et al., 1977).

In the mammalian host, ingested cysts germinate in the small intestine and are carried to the colon, where the amebae attack the epithelial lining. Cysteine proteases are probably a virulence determinant of the amebae (Bruchhaus et al., 2003). In cases of dysentery with accompanying diarrhea, numerous trophic amebae, often containing ingested red blood cells, are found in the unformed or loose stool. In asymptomatic cases, the formed stool contains cysts whose development parallels the removal of water from the stool as it passes to the rectal area. Trophic amebae in unformed stools do not encyst, nor are they infective to others. The cyst, by virtue of its protective wall, is the prime infective stage in the ameba life-cycle. The presence of non-pathogenic commensals in the gut seen upon examination of stool samples can lead to erroneous laboratory diagnoses. Cysts of Entamoeba can remain viable for 2–4 weeks outside of the host provided they are in a moist or wet environment. Desiccation and extreme temperatures can render cysts non-viable. Amebic dysentery is primarily a disease of tropical or sub-tropical areas of the world, where climatic conditions favor cyst survival and sewage is apt to contaminate the drinking water supply.

The primary structure and the hydropathic character of the formyltransferase from Methanosarcina barkeri were compared with those of the enzymes from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanothermus fervidus, and Methanopyrus kandleri. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme from Methanosarcina barkeri was 64%, 61%, and 59% identical to that of the enzyme from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanothermus fervidus, and Methanopyrus kandleri, respectively. A negative correlation between the hydrophobicity of the enzymes and both the growth temperature optimum and the intracellular salt concentration of the four organisms was observed. The hydrophobicity of amino acid composition was +21.6 for the enzyme from Methanosarcina barkeri (growth temperature optimum 37°C, intracellular salt concentration ~ 0.3 M), +9.9 for the enzyme from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (65°C, ~ 0.7 M), -20.8 for the enzyme from Methanothermus fervidus (83°C, ~ 1.0 M) and -31.4 for the enzyme from Methanopyrus kandleri (98°C, > 1.1 M). Generally, a positive correlation between hydrophobicity and thermophilicity of enzymes and a negative correlation between hydrophobicity and halophilicity of enzymes are observed. The findings therefore indicate that the hydropathic character of the formyltransferases compared is mainly determined by the intracellular salt concentration rather than by temperature.

This bacterium follows both acidogenic and acetogenic pathways and converts putrescine to acetate, butyrate, molecular H2, and ammonia. It uses 4-aminobutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate for growth (Matthies et al., 2000). It degrades many anionic surfactants such as alcohol sulfates that could cause severe inhibition in anaerobic digesters (Feitkenhauer and Meyer, 2002). It also ferments glucose to form lactate, acetate, and ethanol as by-products and helps in sulfate reduction, and grows at the optimal temperature of 37 °C and pH range of 7.2–7.6 (Dhouib et al., 2003; Martins et al., 2011). Macellibacteroides fermentans belongs to the family Porphyromonadaceae and phylum Bacteroidetes, metabolizes monosaccharides and disaccharides to produce lactate, acetate, butyrate, and isobutyrate. It also utilizes aesculin and gelatin, and grows at the optimal temperature range of 35–40 °C and pH range of 6.5–7.5 (Hao et al., 2015; Jabari et al., 2012). Saccharofermentans acetigenes belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. This bacterium is an obligatory anaerobe and does not work in a microaerophilic and aerobic environment. The final fermentation products from glucose include acetate, fumarate, and lactate. It produces acids from D-glucose, D-fructose, aesculin, starch, sucrose, adonitol, mannitol, dulcitol, and inositol, and grows at the optimal temperature of 37 °C and pH of 6.5.

This chapter deals with the wide distribution of S-layers among cyanobacteria, and their morphological and chemical characterization, and the potential of high resolution electron microscopic studies applied to the cell envelope of Pyrodictium. The occurrence of S-layers in cyanobecteria was investigated by cryomethods and ultrathin sectioning. These investigations indicate that the ultrastructure of S-layers may be exploited as an auxiliary taxonomic criterion in the classification of cyanobacteria. Pyrodictium is the first organism which has shown an optimum growth temperature above 100°C. The highly irregularly shaped, flagellated cells are interconnected by extracellular tubules. The three-dimensional structure of this network was visualized with high resolution scanning electron microscopy while the fine structure of the cell wall architecture was studied in detail with various electron microscopic techniques.

It has been observed by several researchers (Lonvaud-Funel et al., 1984; Krieger et al., 2000) that a lower inoculation rate, such as in 104–105 cfu/ml can result in higher diacetyl accumulation in wine. Observations made from a winery trial illustrate this point with O. oeni strain BITEC proVino and a Pinot Noir wine, which had an initial diacetyl content of 0.5 mg/l (Fig. 5) . After the completion of MLF, the wine inoculated with 2×104 cfu/ml bacteria contained 3.9 mg/l diacetyl, whereas the wine inoculated at 2×106 cfu/ml had only 1.7 mg/l. The increased final diacetyl content of the wine inoculated at the lower dosage is likely to be due to the extended growth and fermentation period, which in this case, was an additional week. 7.4 Temperature at which MLF is conducted Although ML bacteria have a growth optimum temperature in laboratory media of approximately 27 °C, growth in wine is restricted to the range 15–25 °C with an optimum for most O. oeni cultures around 20–22 °C (Asmundson and Kelly, 1990).", "id": 776, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Oenococcus oeni?", "synonym_description": "Oenococcus oeni is also known as O. oeni.

In the second stage (STR), the growth of Leptospirillum ferriphilum was favoured, since only this strain was detected on the fingerprints in the pulp, on the solid phase and in the liquid phase. Despite the fact that Acidithiobacillus caldus and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans were known to be members of BRGM-KCC consortium inoculated into the bioreactor, they remained undetected. For Acidithiobacillus caldus, which is a sulphur-oxidizing bacterium, this can be explained by the absence of reduced sulphur compounds in the bioreactor. Likewise, the temperature maintained at 35 °C in the bioreactor was probably too low for Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans since the optimum growth temperature is 51 °C for this bacterium [51]. Since most of the cells were attached to the PCBs, SEM was used to correlate the presence of attached cells with the composition of the solid phase (Fig. 12 ). Ten PCB fragments were observed. On some fragments, which were probably glass or ceramic fibres made up of Al, Si and Ca (Fig. 12A), there was little or no bacteria. Round and organic elements appeared to be attached between some fibres (Fig. 12B). A wire linked these elements to the PCB fragment but broke under the electron beam.

It is of great biotechnological interest, as it efficiently deconstructs nonpretreated lignocellulosic plant biomass. Currently, its genetic manipulation relies on a mutant uracil auxotrophic background strain that contains a random deletion in the pyrF genome region. The pyrF gene serves as a genetic marker to select for uracil prototrophy, and it can also be counterselected for loss via resistance to the compound 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). To expand the C. bescii genetic tool kit, kanamycin resistance was developed as a selection for genetic manipulation. A codon-optimized version of the highly thermostable kanamycin resistance gene (named Cbhtk) allowed the use of kanamycin selection to obtain transformants of either replicating or integrating vector constructs in C. bescii. These strains showed resistance to kanamycin at concentrations >50 μg · ml−1, whereas wild-type C. bescii was sensitive to kanamycin at 10 μg · ml−1. In addition, placement of the Cbhtk marker between homologous recombination regions in an integrating vector allowed direct selection of a chromosomal mutation using both kanamycin and 5-FOA. Furthermore, the use of kanamycin selection enabled the targeted deletion of the pyrE gene in wild-type C. bescii, generating a uracil auxotrophic genetic background strain resistant to 5-FOA. The pyrE gene functioned as a counterselectable marker, like pyrF, and was used together with Cbhtk in the ΔpyrE background strain to delete genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase and the CbeI restriction enzyme.", "id": 149, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Caldicellulosiruptor bescii?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "31899+Caldicellulosiruptor bescii"}

Control chambers were placed in a deep-water reservoir and a Flowing-Streams Laboratory, both of which had comparable temperatures to Par Pond. The populations of E. coli were sampled regularly for up to 3 weeks. Viability of the bacteria was determined by dilution plating to nutrient agar followed by replicate plating onto selective medium to determine lactose utilization and nalidixic acid sensitivity. Initial populations of E. coli were lactose positive but changed to lactose negative in Par Pond when the reactor was operating (i.e., cooling water from the heat exchangers was being discharged to the lake). This alteration occurred most rapidly in the chambers closest to the cooling-water discharge point. Such changes did not occur in a deep-water reservoir, in Par Pond when the reactor was not operating, or in the Flowing-Streams Laboratory. The nalidixic acid-resistant characteristic remained stable regardless of the chambers' placement or reactor operations. Although the reasons for such alterations are unclear, it appears that lactose-negative populations of E. coli are selected for in these reactor effluent waters.

All the clinical cases (bacteremia) concerned patients with an underlying malignancy disease (Cannon et al., 2005) or immunodeficient patients and were correlated with the placement of catheters or implantation of artificial materials such as prostheses and cardiac valves (Riegel, 1998; Janda et al., 2003; Beukinga et al., 2004). Within the genus Arthrobacter, A. cumminsii and A. woluwensis are two of the most frequently encountered species among clinical specimens (Funke et al., 1996a, 1998; Bernasconi et al., 2004), but other species have been described, including A. creatinolyticus (Hou et al., 1998), A. oxydans, A. luteolus and A. albus (Wauters et al., 2000). None of these species have been yet isolated from cheese surfaces. Strains isolated from clinical materials have been identified as Microbacterium imperiale and M. arborescens (Funke et al., 1995). Micrococcus luteus and Kocuria kristinae have both been described as capable of causing infections in immunodeficient patients (Peces et al., 1997; Basaglia et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2005). Strains assigned to these three genera have been isolated from ripened cheeses but have never been identified at species level. It cannot be concluded that these strains do not belong to the pathogenic species described above. From a physiological viewpoint, most dairy coryneform bacteria belong to species showing distinct characteristics compared to clinical species.

All the isolates were confirmed to be T. asper-ellum. Analysis using sequence polymorphism-derived markers not only confirmed their identity as T. asper-ellum, but also showed new patterns among Indian isolates and presence of cryptic species T. asperel-loides. Analysis of sequences submitted from India to GenBank as T. viride or T. asperellum using barcode also showed that they belong to T. asperellum and not to true T. viride.

Fig. 9 shows inhibitory effect of sea salts on the enzymatic activity with gradual decrease of the enzymatic activity by increasing the sea salt concentration in the reaction mixture. 3.9 Effects of pH and temperature on the enzyme activity ι-Carrageenase activity was measured at various pH values. As Fig. 10a shows, the enzyme was the most active at pH 7.5–8.0, which was in the normal range of other ι-carrageenases [22,23,35,41,46]. Thus, buffer solution with pH 7.8 was used for further experiments. The ι-carrageenase activity was measured as a function of temperature from 20 to 60 °C. Fig. 10b shows that the enzymatic activity was the highest at 40 °C. This is comparable with other characterized GH82 ι-carrageenases, which prevalently display their maximum activity at 40 °C or higher. The optimal temperature for ι-carrageenase isolated from Alteromonas fortis [22,46], was 40 °C. The maximum activity of ι-carrageenase produced by Cellulophaga sp. was achieved at 45 °C [24].

Thermostability of ι-carrageenase is another useful criterion for the industrial application. Fig. 10c shows that the activity of the residual ι-carrageenase obtained after heating at 35 °C for 30 min still remained around 60% of the control sample activity, indicating that the enzyme was stable up to 35 °C.

After growth for 24 hours on our homemade culture medium at 37°C, the surface colonies were circular, greyish, shiny and smooth, with a diameter of 1 to 2 mm. V. senegalensis is Gram positive (Fig. 4 ). Growth was observed at temperatures ranging from 25 to 40°C, with an optimum at 37°C. The growth required a salinity ranging from 5 to 200 g/L of NaCl (optimum at 75 g/L). The optimum pH for growth was 7.5 (pH range 5 to 9). Growth of the strain SK-1T was tested in an aerobic atmosphere, in the presence of 5% CO2 and also in anaerobic and microaerophilic atmospheres created using AnaeroGen (Atmosphere Generation Systems), respectively. The strain was strictly aerobic and also grew in the presence of 5% CO2 but did not grow in an anaerobic atmosphere. The size and ultrastructure of cells were determined by negative staining transmission electron microscopy 2 to 6 μm in length and 0.5 μm in diameter (Fig. 5 ).

In contrast, other A. fumigatus β-glucosidases showed optimal activity at 50 °C and 60 °C (Saroj and Narasimhulu, 2018). Heat tolerance is a fundamental characteristic of enzymes that can be used in industrial processes. The crude enzyme extracts were incubated at 75 °C, 80 °C, and 85 °C to verify the thermal stability of these enzymes (Fig. 2D). This evaluation revealed that crude β-glucosidase remained stable at 75 °C after 1 h of incubation. Moreover, this enzyme retained approximately 70% of its residual activity after incubation at 80 °C for 1 h without the substrate. A rapid loss of activity was observed when the enzyme was treated at 85 °C. Since high concentrations of substrates tend to stabilize the enzymes, and that the thermostability assays were carried out in the absence of any substrate, the β-glucosidases from A. fumigatus can be presumed to be more thermostable than the assays have revealed here. Thermostability of an enzyme can be determined on the basis of unfolding of the active site of the enzyme measured through activity assays performed at various temperatures. However, in order to perform for such studies, it is indispensable to have the purified enzymes. The crude enzyme extracts were incubated with pNPG and varying concentrations of glucose to determine the extent of glucose inhibition (Fig. 2E). The enzyme showed high glucose tolerance, with a Ki of 543 mM. Conversely, Humicola grisea var. Thermoidea β-glucosidases were stimulated by glucose at concentrations of 25–200 mM (Nascimento et al., 2010). The description of β-glucosidases from distinct microbial sources has been extensively reviewed, and it is widely appreciated that many β-glucosidases are inhibited by glucose (Salgado et al., 2018). The reduction in catalytic activity caused by this inhibitory effect of glucose may result in significant limitations to the applications of these enzymes. Hence, these limitations have encouraged the search for biocatalysts with kinetic properties that are compatible with the accumulation of reaction end-products at high concentrations (Monteiro et al., 2020). To date, only four β-glucosidases, produced by a hyperthermophilic microorganism, exhibit high thermostability and glucose tolerance (Dennett and Blamey, 2016). Genetically manipulated enzymes have been developed to improve the industrial application of β-glucosidases. For instance, the genetically enhanced β-glucosidase Bgl 1317 appears to be the first enzyme of its kind that exhibits acceptable thermostability and glucose tolerance (Liu et al., 2019). This combination of features, namely, the ability to function at elevated temperatures and a high degree of glucose tolerance, is very desirable from a biotechnological perspective and hence, A. fumigatus β-glucosidase is likely to be a promising target for the saccharification of cellulose for second-generation ethanol production. 4 Conclusion Among the thermophilic fungi isolated from the Araucaria forest in the Atlantic forest microbiome, a fungal strain identified as A. fumigatus was selected for further evaluation as it seemed to produce high levels of β-glucosidases, which exhibit intriguing characteristics of being active at high temperatures and tolerance to glucose inhibition. A. fumigatus displayed similar growth at 34 °C and 45 °C, and therefore, it was classified as a thermotolerant strain. Process optimization resulted in the production of 24.53 U/mL of its novel β-glucosidase.

The isotope enrichment factor ε was determined as described by Mariotti et al. (1981) from the residual reactant, calculated as (6) δ r = δ ri + ε [ ln ( 1 - f ) ] and from the product formed, calculated as (7) δ p = δ ri - ε ( 1 - f ) [ ln ( 1 - f ) ] / f where δri is the isotope composition of the reactant at the beginning, δr and δp are the isotope compositions of the residual substrate and the pooled product, respectively, at the instant when f was determined. f is the fractional yield of the products based on the consumption of substrates (0< f <1). An alternative way to calculate the fractional yield purely based on the measured δ-values was promoted by Gelwicks et al.

Fatty acid and isoprenoid quinone analysis The analysis of fatty acid (FA) methyl ethers was performed by gas liquid chromatography, as described previously by Sveta- shev et al. [45]. Bacteria were grown at 28 °C. For quinone analysis, selected strains were grown in liquid medium B for 24 h at room temperature (ca. 22–24 °C) on a ro- tary shaker at 160 rpm. Biomass was harvested and lyophilized. Isoprenoid quinones were extracted and analyzed from lyophilized cells, as described by Moule and Wilkinson [29]. Phylogenetic analysis Bacterial DNAs for PCR were prepared using the Promega Wizard genomic DNA extraction kit according to the instruc- tion manual. A hundred ng of DNA templates were used in a PCR to amplify the small-subunit rDNA genes (primer 24F cor- responding the 8–24 position of the E. coli sequence and 1540R, 1541–1522) as previously described by Sawabe et al.

The thermal profile then consisted of 30 cycles. The amplification primers used in this study gave a 1.5 kb long PCR product and corresponded to positions 25 to 1521 of the E. coli 16S rDNA sequence. The PCR products were purified using a Promega Wizard PCR preps DNA purification kit, and sequenced directly using a Taq FS dye terminator se- quencing kit (ABI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 310 automated sequencer. Nine sequencing primers were used for sequencing [30]. The new 16S rDNA sequences were automatically,and then manually aligned by reference to a database of 35 000 already aligned bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. For the NJ analysis, a matrix distance was calculated according to the Kimura two pa- rameters correction. Bootstraps were done using 500 replica- tions, bioNJ and Kimura two parameters corrections. BioNJ was performed according to the method, while the maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony programs were conducted using MEGA ver.2.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "However, E. histolytica in the dog rarely encysts, and trophic amebae in dog stools are not infective (Barr, 1998; Eyles et al., 1954). In the mammalian host, ingested cysts germinate in the small intestine and are carried to the colon, where the amebae attack the epithelial lining. Cysteine proteases are probably a virulence determinant of the amebae (Bruchhaus et al., 2003). In cases of dysentery with accompanying diarrhea, numerous trophic amebae, often containing ingested red blood cells, are found in the unformed or loose stool. In asymptomatic cases, the formed stool contains cysts whose development parallels the removal of water from the stool as it passes to the rectal area. Trophic amebae in unformed stools do not encyst, nor are they infective to others. The cyst, by virtue of its protective wall, is the prime infective stage in the ameba life-cycle. The presence of non-pathogenic commensals in the gut seen upon examination of stool samples can lead to erroneous laboratory diagnoses. Cysts of Entamoeba can remain viable for 2–4 weeks outside of the host provided they are in a moist or wet environment. Desiccation and extreme temperatures can render cysts non-viable. Amebic dysentery is primarily a disease of tropical or sub-tropical areas of the world, where climatic conditions favor cyst survival and sewage is apt to contaminate the drinking water supply. But sporadic outbreaks of the disease have occurred throughout the world, regardless of temperatures, and one such textbook example occurred in Chicago during the 1933 World's Fair with over 1000 cases (Albach and Booden, 1978). In addition to humans, E. histolytica is found in a large number of non-human primates and, less often, in dogs (Barr, 1998; Eyles et al., 1954). Another species, E. polecki, found in pigs has been reported from humans but is not highly infective for humans (Levine, 1961). E. moshkovskii, an ameba morphologically similar to E. histolytica but non-pathogenic, has been isolated from sewage in several parts of the world and, recently, has been reported in 21% of Bangladeshi children sampled as a non-invasive commensal (Ali et al., 2003).

Heat and cold are two very important environmental abiotic factors that restrict the use of entomopathogenic fungi as agents for biological control of insects. Most entomopathogenic fungi have optimal growth temperatures between 25 and 35°C (Roberts and Campbell, 1977). Beauveria bassiana grows at a wide temperature range (from 8 to 35°C) with a maximum thermal threshold for growth at 37°C (Fargues et al., 1997a). The dormant conidia of fungi, however, tolerate higher temperatures than mycelium due to (a) higher amounts of saturated fatty acids, which decreases cellular membrane permeability (Crisan, 1973; Pupin et al., 2000; Guerzoni et al., 2001), and (b) higher amounts of trehalose and mannitol, which provides protection against denaturation of proteins and membranes (Thevelein, 1984; Rangel et al., 2006). The thermal death point for conidia of B. bassiana isolates has been found to be between 45 and 50°C (Liu et al., 2003), or even up to 55°C (Varela and Morales, 1996), after 10min exposure. Effective use of insect pathogens within integrated pest management programs necessitates the selection of fungal pathogens tolerant of the temperature range found in the ecosystem involved. For example, isolates active at temperatures below 15°C have been selected for control of curculionids in a temperate climate (Doberski, 1981; Soares et al., 1983); or isolates adapted to temperatures above 25°C have been sought for control of noctuids in the southeastern USA (Ignoffo et al., 1976; Mohamed et al., 1977).", "id": 617, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Metarhizium anisopliae?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "5530+Metarhizium anisopliae"}

(1995) who observed consumption of methane and oxygen and production of nitrous oxide (Amaral et al., 1995). Several other studies have demonstrated nitrate removal, but the experimental setups have not allowed quantification of produced nitrous oxide and dinitrogen and therefore nitrate assimilation and denitrification could not be clearly distinguished (Werner and Kayser, 1991; Thalasso et al., 1997; Houbron et al., 1999; Rajapakse and Scutt, 1999; Waki et al., 2005). 3.2 Microbiological studies Apart from Rhee and Fuhs (1978) and Meschner and Hamer (1985) who studied interactions between specific bacterial isolates there have been few studies on the microbiological composition of mixed cultures accomplishing AME-D. The role of both methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the AME-D process was confirmed by Waki et al. (2004) who added inhibitors of methane oxidation (methyl fluoride) and nitrite reduction (tungstate), which both led to decreased AME-D activity as compared to controls (Waki et al., 2004). The most extensive study was carried out by Costa et al. (2000) who examined the microbial community in an oxygen-limited AME-D activated sludge reactor. The bacterial populations in the reactor consisted of high numbers of methanotrophs and acetate-degrading denitrifiers and relatively low numbers of methanol-degrading denitrifiers. Two acetate-degrading strains resembling Mesorhizobium plurifarium within alpha-Proteobacteria and Stenotrophomonas sp. within gamma-Proteobacteria, one methanol-degrading strain moderately related to H. vulgare and Pedomicrobium australicum both within the alpha-Proteobacteria, and the most abundant methanotroph belonging to the Type II methanotrophs and closely related to Methylocysitis sp. strain EB-1 were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Similarly, it has been reported that the cytochrome complement of anaerobic S. putrefaciens NCMB 400 cells is independent of the electron acceptor used but the total cytochrome content in fumarate-grown cells is consistently higher [61]. However, we have not examined the potential effect of all possible electron acceptors on cytochrome content and distribution in MR-1 cells, so we cannot exclude the possibility that growth with other electron acceptors may result in marked differences from our current findings. In summary, four distinct c-type cytochromes are evident in the OM of anaerobically grown MR-1. These cytochromes are oxidized by oxidized forms of iron and manganese, which have previously been shown to serve as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration in MR-1. The 83-kDa OM cytochrome was purified, and Western blots using specific antisera for this protein demonstrated that the vast majority is localized to the OM and an intermediate density membrane fraction of similar composition. Its specific content is markedly increased by a switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, suggesting that its de novo synthesis is significantly increased under anaerobic conditions. Other studies are currently underway in our lab to discern the in vivo role of these OM cytochromes.

Thus, acidic optimal pH and moderate thermophilic properties of PaXyn10A are advantages for application in the bioconversion process. 3.4 Substrate specificity, kinetic parameters, and hydrolysis property of PaXyn10A PaXyn10A showed the highest activity towards beechwood xylan (1443 U/mg), followed by oat spelt xylan (1180 U/mg) and birchwood xylan (1060 U/mg), and showed trace activity towards barely β-glucan (10 U/mg) (Table S1), but no activity towards other tested substrates, including CMC, chitin, locust bean gum, chitosan, and pNP-β-xylopyranoside. K m and V max values of PaXyn10A for xylans from beechwood, birchwood, and oat spelt were 2.3 mg/mL and 10,600 μmol/min/mg, 3.7 mg/mL and 4380 μmol/min/mg, and 16.5 mg/mL and 7560 μmol/min/mg, respectively. PaXyn10A could hydrolyze birchwood xylan and beechwood xylan efficiently. Hydrolysis products at 30 min were mainly XOSs with DP 2–10, and XOSs with DP 4 and 7–10 were then converted to xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylopentaose during 12 h (Fig. 3 a, b). In addition, oat spelt xylan was hydrolyzed by PaXyn10A to yield XOS with DP 2–8 at initial 1 h. After incubation for 12 h, xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose were the major final product (Fig. 3c). PaXyn10A hydrolyzed X5 and X6 to produce mainly X2 and X3 as well as little amount of X4 (Fig. 3g, h). It hydrolyzed X4 and X3 to produce X2 and X3 as well as trace amount of xylose (Fig. 3e, f). Furthermore, the enzyme couldn’t hydrolyze X2 (Fig. 3d). PaXyn10A showed a broad substrate specificity towards xylans and β-1,3-1,4-glucans (Table S1). So far, some fungal GH family 10 xylanases have exhibited broad substrate specificities, such as xylanases from G. trabeum and P. chrysogenum (Wang et al., 2016; Ullah et al., 2019). The K m value of PaXyn10A towards birchwood xylan was 3.67 mg/mL, which is obviously lower compared with most other fungal xylanase having K m values in the 4.0–25.5 mg/mL range (Cai et al., 2011; Basotra et al., 2018; Ghaffar et al., 2011), revealing higher affinity of PaXyn10A for birchwood xylan. Currently, xylooligosaccharides can maintain human gastrointestinal health by selectively enhancing the growth of prebiotic bacteria (Karlsson et al., 2018). Moreover, xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose played important roles in bio-function properties of XOS (Amorim et al., 2019). PaXyn10A hydrolyzed different xylans to release mainly xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylopentaose. Moreover, it could hydrolyze xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with degree of polymerization above 2. These results suggested that PaXyn10A was an endo-type xylanase.", "id": 929, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Ustilago maydis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "5270+Ustilago maydis"}
{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "3.4 Paecilomyces spp. As in the case of S. apiospermum, one strain of Paecilomyces variotii has been isolated from a gas-phase biofilter and that organism has been used as inoculum in a biofilter fed toluene-polluted air (Estévez et al., 2004). The genus Paecilomyces is closely related to the genus Penicillium, but the colonies of the former are usually white to yellow-brown, while those of Penicillium are most often green or blue-green. It was also recently reported that strains of P. variotii can grow on diesel oil in aqueous phase (Bento and Gaylarde, 2001). Diesel oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of about 30% n-alkanes, 45% cyclic alkanes and 24% aromatics (Frankenberger et al., 1989). However, the authors did not check the nature of the specific oil components used by the fungus. It is not clear if they grew on either the aliphatic or the aromatic fraction of oil, or both. Some Paecilomyces strains are resistant to heavy metals, and lead tolerant Paecilomyces species have been used in bioremediation studies for the biosorption of heavy metals (Wise, 1997). Although Paecilomyces spp. are deuteromycetes and do not belong to the group of white-rot fungi, it is worth mentioning that some strains are able to degrade lignin and lignin-related aromatic compounds as well (Kluczek-Turpeinen et al., 2003). A strain of Paecilomyces, isolated from a coastal marine environment and identified at the genus level, was able to grow on n-alkylbenzenes provided that the side chain contained at least four carbons (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). It could not grow on benzene, toluene or ethylbenzene. The transient accumulation and subsequent removal of benzoic and phenyl acetic acids suggests that Paecilomyces strain initially attacked the n-alkyl side chain and also metabolized the aromatic ring (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). The P. variotii strain isolated in our laboratory used toluene as sole carbon and energy source in a mineral medium, with production of carbon dioxide. Our on-going studies indicate that it is unable to metabolize benzene, ethylbenzene or xylenes as single substrates. Toluene was degraded with ammonium as nitrogen source but not with nitrate. No transient accumulation of intermediate products was detected in that strain. Biodegradation of alkylbenzenes does usually start with the hydroxylation of the side chain. Biodegradation of benzene, without any side chain, has not been detected in Paecilomyces strains. Nevertheless, P. lilanicus SBUG-M 1093 was recently shown to partly metabolize biphenyl, a molecule containing two benzene rings without any side-chain, by a first hydroxylation step of one of the benzene rings to form 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybiphenyls (Gesell et al., 2001). Some Paecilomyces strains are thermotolerant and may grow at temperatures above 45–50°C. However, our P. variotii strain could not assimilate toluene at such high temperatures. Either Paecilomyces may grow in the form of pellets or its growth may be characterized by a typical filamentous hyphal aspect (Sinha et al., 2001). It was observed that in Paecilomyces japonica the formation of pellets rather than free mycelia is favoured by high aeration and optimal substrate concentration, as well as mild agitation in aqueous phase (Sinha et al., 2001). Paecilomyces spp. are normally not considered as pathogens and are seldom responsible for human infections, although they may occasionally be involved in mycosis in immunosuppressed patients. 3.5 Cladosporium spp. Although the growth on volatile aliphatic hydrocarbons as n-alkanes by deuteromycetes belonging to the genus Cladosporium was reported several years ago (Siporin and Cooney, 1975; Lindley and Heydeman, 1983, 1986), the isolation and detailed study of strains growing on aromatic pollutants is much more recent. Several years ago, it was mentioned that Cladosporium sphaerospermum ATCC 22711 exhibited a low growth on benzene as well as o- and m-xylenes, although no further information was given (Cofone et al., 1973).", "id": 1088, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Scedosporium apiospermum?", "synonym_description": "Scedosporium apiospermum is also known as S. apiospermum.

With three exceptions where an unexpected T m was obtained, there was a perfect correlation between the 775 results obtained with the C. coli/C. jejuni and C. fetus real-time PCRs and the phenotypic methods used as a standard. Analysis by standard PCR [9,10] and 16S rDNA sequencing demonstrated that two of the discrepant isolates were hippurate-negative C. jejuni strains, resulting in an erroneous phenotypic identification, while the third was an isolate of C. coli that contained a gyrA gene typical of C. jejuni, resulting in misidentification by the FRET assay. This last discrepant result could possibly be explained by horizontal transfer of the gyrA gene from C. jejuni to C. coli. Hakanen et al. [23] have reported horizontal gene transfer between Campylobacter spp., and described six C. jejuni strains that had replaced their gyrA gene with a gene received from C. coli. This transfer involved the conserved region of the gyrA gene associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and resulted in antibiotic resistance. In the present study, which concerned the conserved region of the gyrA gene, this event appeared to be very rare, as it occurred only once (0.13%) among the 775 isolates studied. Accurate species identification of Campylobacter isolates is important because it is the first step in comparing isolates for epidemiological studies; indeed, it is possible that outbreaks have gone unnoticed in the past in the absence of proper identification of Campylobacter spp. Compared to phenotypic tests, the assay described in the present study has a higher specificity.

This indicates that strain Y33 might represent a novel species of the genus Algoriphagus (Supplementary Fig. S1). Strain Algoriphagus sp. Y33 shows the ability of nitrate reduction. Consistently, Algoriphagus sp. Y33 contains genes of nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, as well as ammonia assimilation genes, such as glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Therefore, Algoriphagus sp. Y33 displayed the capacity of the nitrogen transformations: NO3 − → NO2 − → NH4 + → organic nitrogen. Although complete gene sequencing was performed for Algoriphagus resistens NH1T before, no sequence data was found in NCBI. Then, to our knowledge, this is the first complete genome sequence of Algoriphagus sp. isolated from the shallow water of Indian Ocean. The genomic data allows us to gain considerable information for the nitrogen utilization and transformation of Algoriphagus species, as well as the nitrogen cycle in ocean ecosystem. 2 Data description The strain Y33 was cultured at 25 °C in 50 mL of marine Zobell 2216E medium (peptone, 5 g/L, yeast extract 1 g/L, natural seawater, 1 L) for 48 h at 150 rpm. Bacterial suspensions were inoculated in API 20 NE according to the manufacturers' instructions. Results were recorded after 7 d of incubation at 25 °C. We found that the strain was able to turn NO3 − cup from colorless to pink, indicating the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite (Supplementary Fig. S2). The general features of Algoriphagus sp. Y33 are listed in Table 1 . In summary, strain Y33 is rod-shaped, strictly aerobic, heterotrophic, and Gram-negative.

Growths were followed by sampling 1 mL of culture medium and measuring the OD at 600 nm, except for A. gossypii. All data were collected in biological triplicates, where three separate cultures were inoculated then treated of the same manner. 2.6 Enzymes activities 2.6.1 Enzymes extraction Enzymes extraction was achieved from the cultures in minimal medium. For α-amylase, xylanase and β-glucosidase activities, 1 mL of culture was lysed in microtubes containing ≈ 5 mm of zirconia-coated silica-microbeads (11079101z, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, USA) with a vortex mixer for 10−20' at room temperature. Microtubes were then centrifuged and supernatants were collected. For LAP activities, 1 mL of culture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Controls were non-inoculated media incubated with the same conditions. All data for enzyme extraction were collected in biological triplicates, with samples obtained from three separate cultures. Enzymatic activity was expressed in international units (IU), where 1 IU is the quantity of enzyme required to release 1 μmole of reducing sugar per min. Temperature for the reactions were the same as the growth temperatures of the corresponding microorganisms. 2.6.2 α-amylase and xylanase activities Those activities were assessed by measuring the reducing sugars liberated from xylans or starch by the xylanase or amylase activities, respectively. Done according to the Kidby-Davidson methodology as previously described (Rémond et al., 2010). 100 μL of enzyme extracts were incubated with 900 μL of either native potato starch (1259, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or xylan from beechwood (4414.4, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 0.5 % (w/v) in Tris−HCl, 10 mM, pH 7.5. 100 μL of the mix was added to 1.5 mL of alkaline ferricyanide reactant after 0′, 5′ and 10′ of reaction.

The absorbance was measured at 401 nm for 15′. 2.6.4 LAP activity This activity was assessed using L-Leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride (LAP) (L2145, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Reaction were made with 1050 μL of Tris−HCl 10 mM, pH 7.0; 300 μL of LAP 200 μM in ultrapure water; 150 μL of enzyme extract. Reactions were incubated between 10′ and 3 h in order to obtain significant activities without using all the LAP substrate. Reactions were stopped with 10 μL of NaOH 1 M. 250 μL of each reaction mix were dispatched 5 timed in a 96-well black microplate for fluorescence (MaxiSorp Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "According to Cox et al. (1996b), styrene metabolism in E. jeanselmei starts with the attack of the vinyl side chain and the formation of phenylacetic acid, which is then hydroxylated to homogentisic acid to be finally mineralized to water and carbon dioxide. Similar metabolic reactions may be expected for toluene, with an initial reaction at the level of the methyl group resulting in the formation of benzyl alcohol and then benzoic acid before mineralization. It was observed that in other fungi as Mortierella isabellina and Helminthosporium the metabolism of toluene is also characterized by the hydroxylation of the side chain leading to the formation of benzyl alcohol (Holland et al., 1988). As will be described below, the same holds for most of the fungi described in this paper. 3.3 Scedosporium spp. The isolation of Scedosporium apiospermum from a gas-phase biofilter degrading toluene has been described on one occasion as well as its inoculation in such systems (García-Peña et al., 2001). S. apiospermum is an ascomycete belonging to the family of Microascaceae. Although Scedosporium spp. were already known to oxidize aliphatic pollutants as hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) and alcohols (Onodera et al., 1989b; Onodera and Ogasawara, 1989c), their ability to assimilate toluene had not been described before. Their maximum growth temperature may occasionally reach 40°C. Some strains of S. apiospermum have proven to be the responsible agent of cystic fibrosis (Cimon et al., 2000) and cutaneous infections but mainly in immunosuppressed patients (Chaveiro et al., 2003). The removal of other alkylbenzenes or hydrophobic VOCs in general has not been described. 3.4 Paecilomyces spp. As in the case of S. apiospermum, one strain of Paecilomyces variotii has been isolated from a gas-phase biofilter and that organism has been used as inoculum in a biofilter fed toluene-polluted air (Estévez et al., 2004). The genus Paecilomyces is closely related to the genus Penicillium, but the colonies of the former are usually white to yellow-brown, while those of Penicillium are most often green or blue-green. It was also recently reported that strains of P. variotii can grow on diesel oil in aqueous phase (Bento and Gaylarde, 2001). Diesel oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of about 30% n-alkanes, 45% cyclic alkanes and 24% aromatics (Frankenberger et al., 1989). However, the authors did not check the nature of the specific oil components used by the fungus. It is not clear if they grew on either the aliphatic or the aromatic fraction of oil, or both. Some Paecilomyces strains are resistant to heavy metals, and lead tolerant Paecilomyces species have been used in bioremediation studies for the biosorption of heavy metals (Wise, 1997). Although Paecilomyces spp. are deuteromycetes and do not belong to the group of white-rot fungi, it is worth mentioning that some strains are able to degrade lignin and lignin-related aromatic compounds as well (Kluczek-Turpeinen et al., 2003). A strain of Paecilomyces, isolated from a coastal marine environment and identified at the genus level, was able to grow on n-alkylbenzenes provided that the side chain contained at least four carbons (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). It could not grow on benzene, toluene or ethylbenzene. The transient accumulation and subsequent removal of benzoic and phenyl acetic acids suggests that Paecilomyces strain initially attacked the n-alkyl side chain and also metabolized the aromatic ring (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). The P. variotii strain isolated in our laboratory used toluene as sole carbon and energy source in a mineral medium, with production of carbon dioxide. Our on-going studies indicate that it is unable to metabolize benzene, ethylbenzene or xylenes as single substrates. Toluene was degraded with ammonium as nitrogen source but not with nitrate. No transient accumulation of intermediate products was detected in that strain. Biodegradation of alkylbenzenes does usually start with the hydroxylation of the side chain. Biodegradation of benzene, without any side chain, has not been detected in Paecilomyces strains.", "id": 931, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Exophiala jeanselmei?", "synonym_description": "Exophiala jeanselmei is also known as E. jeanselmei.

For industrial application of aldose isomerases generally thermostable enzymes, such as D-xylose isomerase [25] and l-arabinose isomerase [26], are required. Thermosediminibacter oceani DSM 16646 is an anaerobic hyperthermophilic bacterium isolated from deep sea sediments of Peru Margin and the optimal growth temperature is 65°C [27]. The complete genome sequence of the strain has recently been determined and deposited in GenBank with accession No. NC_014377 [28]. The genome sequence reveals the presence of a putative D-LI gene (locus_tag: CP002131.1; protein ID: ADL08607.1). In this study, the putative D-LI gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). This recombinant D-LI was then purified by metal affinity chromatography, characterized and the d-mannose production from d-fructose was studied. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals and reagents The carbohydrate standards, including d-fructose, d-mannose, d-lyxose, and d-xylulose were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Tryptone and yeast extract for Luria-Bertani (LB) broth were purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI, USA). All other chemicals were at least of analytical grade obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China) and Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2 Bacterial strain, plasmid, and culture conditions The E. coli BL21(DE3) strain was used for heterologous expression and the plasmid pET-22b(+) was used as an expression vector. The E. coli cells were cultivated in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (pH 7.5), composed of 10g/L trypone, 5g/L yeast extract, and 5g/L of NaCl. 2.3 Gene cloning and expression The putative D-LI gene (locus_tag: CP002131.1; protein ID: ADL08607.1) from T. oceani DSM 16646 has been published in the open GenBank database. In this work, the full length of the target gene was commercially synthesized by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China), with an in-frame C-terminal 6×histidine-tag sequence, and was cloned into the expression vector pET-22b(+) with NdeI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-terminus. The constructed plasmid harboring T. oceani D-LI genes was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for overexpression.

The B. cepacia are reported in a variety of resources viz. water, soil, infected plants and animals and even in humans (Miller et al., 2002). Apart from their property as plant and human pathogen their role in bioremediation has also been described. This involves the breaking of toxic compounds which have been applied in agricultural crops in the form of pesticides and herbicides. The strains of Burkholderia sp. has also been observed for the metabolism of pyrene, which was classified as highly recalcitrant compounds in the class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This was observed through bacterial consortium isolated from polluted site of Amlakhadi, Ankleshwar, Gujarat, India. This consortium metabolized pyrene and three bacterial species recovered were viz. Pseudomonas sp. ASDP1, Burkholderia sp. ASDP2, and Rhodococcus sp. ASDP3. These strains also played role in biological control of plant diseases which led to increase the crop yield (Parke et al., 2001). But, in contrast to these beneficial properties, several Burkholderia sp. strains of Burkholderia cepacia complex was noted as human opportunistic pathogens, and reported to cause infection in cystic fibrosis patients (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2000, 2005).

A recent study in Oregon soils also found that the optimum temperatures of soil AOA were more than 12 °C higher than soil AOB (Taylor et al., 2017). In contrast to AOA, AOB may prefer lower temperature environments with the optimum temperatures range 20–31 °C (Table 2 ). Currently there are no literature reports of AOB in environments where temperature remains higher than 40 °C (Hatzenpichler, 2012). AOB communities were mainly affiliated with the Nitrosospira lineage in our soils (Ouyang et al., 2016), strains of Nitrosospira isolated from soil environments have temperature optimum between 25 °C and 31 °C (Table 2).", "id": 1362, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Nitrososphaera?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "497726+Nitrososphaera"}

For instance, strains AK15T and AK18 differed from Photobacterium jeanii with respect to cell size, salinity growth range, temperature growth range, catalase activity, hydrolysis of complex substrates, susceptibility to different antibiotics and fatty acid composition (Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1). Thus, the cumulative differences that strain AK15T exhibits with the above closely related type strains unambiguously supports the creation of a new species of the genus Photobacterium for which the name Photobacterium marinum sp. nov. is proposed.

Two strains of E. coli, BL21 and JM109 carrying the recombinant plasmid pET-20b-Dt-2286 were compared, and BL21 with higher expression was selected. Then, the culture conditions of BL21 carrying recombinant plasmid pET-20b-Dt-2286 in LB medium were optimized. After optimizing the culture conditions, cultures grown on IPTG reached a maximum β-xylosidase activity of 102 U/mL in LB medium (data not shown), which was approximately 42 times as much as β-xylosidase from the same thermophilic bacteria (maximum β-xylosidase activity of 2.4 U/mL in LB medium) [8] and 20 times as much as β-xylosidase from Thermotoga petrophila (the β-xylosidase activity of recombinant Tpexyl3 was 6.81 U/mL in LB medium) [9]. To achieve the maximum β-xylosidase activity of crude recombinant β-xylosidase Dt-2286, we chose a more nutritious medium (TB), and optimized the composition of the carbon sources.

The phylogenetic position of the novel isolate based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence was shown in Fig. 2 . The phylogenetic tree indicated that strain MKT110T constituted a sister clade of genus Zooshikella and the isolate formed a separate cluster with four clones (AB054136, AB054161, AY700600, AY700601), as indicated by the 100% bootstrap value, thus creating a novel taxon. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between MKT110T and the four clones (AB054136, AB054161, AY700600, and AY700601) were 96.9%, 96.8%, 95.6%, and 95.2%, respectively. In a previous study, the genus Zooshikella was suggested to be a sister taxon to the genus Hahella clade in a neighbor-joining tree based on nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences [14]. However, this study showed that Zooshikella constituted a sister clade of strain MKT110T and the clade that contained both genera was more closely related to Oceanospirillum, Microbulbifer, Marinobacter, Saccharospirillum and Pseudomonas than to the genus Hahella. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between MKT110T and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396T or H. ganghwensis FR1050T were only 88.8% and 89.1%, respectively. Discussion The isolate MKT110T had <92% similarity with the species that have validly published names. Neighbor-joining analyses placed MKT110T in the γ-subclass of the proteobacteria, and the closest cultured bacterial relatives were Zooshikella, Oceanospirillum, Microbulbifer, Marinobacter, Saccharospirillum, and Pseudomonas. Among them, Zooshikella was the most closely related with the isolate on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. The similarity between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain MKT110T and Zooshikella was 91.4%, which was higher than the similarity between MKT110T and any of the other validly published names. The sister relationship of strain MKT110T to genus Zooshikella is supported with a bootstrap value of 88%. However, MKT110T was clearly different from Zooshikella in colony color, maximum growth temperature, G+C content and hydroxy fatty acid profile. The colony color of MKT110T is beige, while that of Zooshikella is yellowish-red or red.

Blajman et al. (2018) also reported the presence of heterofermentative LAB in silage with a long storage period. This finding can be explained by interactions between microorganisms, a tolerance for acidic conditions and a reduction in carbohydrate availability associated with the ability of some heterofermentative LAB to use lactic acid as a substrate (Axelsson, 2004). Among the LAB, the genus Lactobacillus is known as the most tolerant to acidity and in general, bacteria of this genus dominate the final stage of several fermentative processes (Axelsson, 2004).

The broths were incubated for 36 h and the growth was monitored by taking the absorbance at 600 nm. The production of EPS in the cell-free supernatant after 36 h of incubation was detected by the phenol–sulphuric acid method (Dubois, Gilles, Hamilton, Rebers, & Smith, 1956). 2.2.2 Optimization of EPS production by RSM After the screening of suitable carbon and nitrogen source for optimal production of EPS, RSM was used to optimize the composition. Three factors were selected which were denoted as A, B and C for mannose, ammonium nitrate and pH, respectively. The pH was selected as one of the factors because it significantly affects EPS production. The concentration of mannose, ammonium nitrate and the pH were developed based on the central composite design (CCD). The experimental models were designed and analyzed by Design Expert v12 (State-Ease Inc. MN, USA). 2.3 Extraction and purification of EPS The EPS was extracted by using a previously described method (Lakra, Domdi, Tilwani, & Arul, 2020). The crude EPS was obtained by ethanol precipitation method and subjected to DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column and Sephadex-G 75 for purification by using AKTA prime (GE Healthcare, Sweden). The fractions obtained were estimated for the sugar content by using a phenol-sulphuric acid method (Dubois et al., 1956). The purified fractions were evaluated for the presence of impurities (such as protein and nucleic acid) by performing a wave-scan from 210 to 400 nm by using a spectrophotometer. The purified EPS was further dialyzed and lyophilized. The pure EPS obtained after lyophilization was used for characterization and for the evaluation of different biological activities. 2.4 Characterization of EPS The monosaccharide analysis was performed by RP–HPLC after pre-column derivatization using PMP (Qi et al., 2012). To perform this, the polysaccharide (20 mg) was hydrolyzed by trifluoroacetic acid (2 mol/L) at 120 °C for 2 h. To the hydrolyzed fraction, methanol was added to eliminate the acid with the help of rotavapor.", "id": 660, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Weissella cibaria?", "synonym_description": "Weissella cibaria is also known as W. cibaria.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "L'excretion du CO 2 marque varie en fonction de la vitesse de vidange gas- trique [83] et de I'importance de I'infection par H. pylori [8]. Un repas d'epreuve a pour but de retarder la vidange gastrique, ce qui fait que I'isotope est retenu plus Iongtemps dans I'estomac [3]. II s'agit d'un repas fiche en lipides et/ou en glucides [22] ou d'une solution d'acide citrique [46]. Ceci ameliore I'efficacite du test et permet de diminuer la quantite d'uree marquee ingeree. Le protocole recommande actuellement est le suivant : le malade dolt etre & jeun depuis la veille et prendre le repas d'epreuve 10 minutes avant I'ingestion d'uree marquee. Afin d'eviter les faux positifs dus & la liberation precoce de CO 2 mar- que par les bacteries de I'oropharynx, il faut observer un temps d'at- tente de dix minutes apres I'ingestion d'uree marquee avant de recueillir I'air. Certains preconisent egalement le brossage des dents. L'avantage du 14C-TRU (test respiratoire & I'uree) est de pouvoir dis- poser relativement facilement de compteurs & scintillation pour I'ana- lyse du 14CO2. En revanche, il necessite du personnel forme, des condi- tions de stockage particulieres, la tenue d'un livre de stock et, de plus, le malade dolt etre prevenu du faible risque de radiation existant. Le 13C-TRU est prefere au 140-TRU car il utilise un isotope stable (inof- fensif, pas de restriction, pas d'autorisation speciale, pas de condition de stockage particuliere). Son principal inconvenient est le co~t, lie au prix de I'uree marquee et & I'utilisation d'un spectrometre de masse necessaire pour realiser I'analyse. D'autres techniques ont egalement ete utilisees, relies que la spectrophotometrie infrarouge [43] ou I'ana- lyse au laser [93]. Par ailleurs, un protocole a ete valide en Europe pour le 13C-TRU, ce qui n'est pas le cas du 14C-TRU [55].", "id": 440, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Helicobacter pylori?", "synonym_description": "Helicobacter pylori is also known as H. pylori.
