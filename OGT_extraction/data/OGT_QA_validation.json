M. sedula, growing at 74°C, pH 2.0, and a dilution rate of 0.04 hr(sup-1), was subjected to both abrupt and gradual temperature shifts in continuous culture to determine the responses of cell density levels and protein synthesis patterns. An abrupt temperature shift from 74 to 79°C resulted in little, if any, changes in cell density and a small increase in total protein per cell. When the culture temperature was shifted further to 80.5°C, cell density dropped to below 5 x 10(sup6) cells/ml from 10(sup8) cells/ml, leading to washout of the culture. Operation at this temperature and slightly higher temperatures, however, could be achieved by exposing the culture to thermal stress more gradually (0.5°C increments). As a result, stable operation could be maintained at temperatures of up to 81°C, and the washout temperature could be increased to 82.5°C. Continuous culture operation at 81°C for 100 h (stressed phase) led to an approximately sevenfold lower steady-state cell density than that observed for operation at or below 79°C. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (both one and two dimensional) revealed significantly higher levels (sixfold increase) of a 66-kDa stress response protein (MseHSP60), immunologically related to Thermophilic Factor 55 from Sulfolobus shibatae (J.

A. fulgidus is a sulfate-reducing archaeon, which grows at between 60 and 95°C, with an optimum growth at 83°C.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [1747], "text": ["37 °C"]}, "context": "3 Results 3.1 Defining backstage microbiological considerations 3.1.1 General description Describing the kinetic behaviour in a dynamic temperature environment necessitates the formulation of a number of microbiological considerations. These considerations aim at the accurate numerical simulation of the evolution of a target microorganism under dynamic temperature profiles. They can be denominated as backstage considerations (Valdramidis et al., 2003) because they are more or less hidden from the audience. In other words, these elements are not incorporated within the mathematical model(s) and thus are not front stage facts. The major microbiological considerations to be cogitated during numerical simulations of a target microorganism inactivation under dynamic temperature conditions can be formulated as follows. (1) Is there any microbial growth possible during the time to reach the desired inactivation temperature (i.e., come-up time)? (2) What is the lowest temperature at which inactivation starts? (3) Is there any increase in the heat resistance of the microorganism due to the gradual increase of the temperature? Answers to these questions—based on literature and/or experimental observations—lead to the formulation of a number of hypotheses, which may reasonably differ for different microorganisms and thermal treatments. If these issues are neglected or underestimated, microbial simulations will not reflect the true kinetic behaviour. 3.1.2 Considerations for this case study For the case of E. coli O157:H7, the following considerations can be formulated. (1) Cardinal temperature values of E. coli O157:H7 are (i) the minimum growth temperature, approximately 8 °C, (ii) the optimum growth temperature, approximately 37 °C, and (iii) the maximum growth temperature, approximately 45 °C (ICMSF, 1996). Additionally, the highest growth rate of E. coli 2 ETEC is not exceeding 3 logs [cfu mL−1] per 3.5 h when the temperature is between 32.8 and 40 °C (ICMSF, 1996) and in general the minimal generation time of microorganism is around 10 min. Finally, the use of stationary phase cultures of a level up to 109 cfu/mL for this case study entails the cessation of cell division. This means that no relevant growth of the examined microorganism is to be expected. (2) Thermal inactivation experiments of E. coli K12 MG1655 at 49.5 °C (results not shown), following the same protocol for the data generation as the one presented, show a shoulder length, S l, of 180 min. Therefore, it is assumed that inactivation of E. coli starts at temperatures above 49.5 °C. (3) To the best of our knowledge, there are no literature data available (reporting counts of viable microbial population) determining quantitatively the effect of rising temperatures on the heat resistance of E. coli. Though, studies on L. monocytogenes have shown a maximum thermo-tolerance induced at heating rates below (or equal to) 0.7 °C min−1 (Stephens et al., 1994). It can reasonably be assumed that in case of fast heating treatments the time frame is too short to induce an increase in the heat resistance of E. coli K12 MG1655. Formulation of these microbiological considerations is dependent on the case study at hand. Other conclusions may be drawn if, for example, there are slower heating rates than those described in this study. 3.2 Separate validation of the formulated thermal model Kondjoyan and Havet (2003) describe the first validation step in which a laboratory setup was used. Calculated temperature profiles of this validation procedure are presented in Section 3.3.1. As a second step, thermal validation was performed on the test rig under study in the BUGDEATH project. Similarly to the model validation procedure (Section 2.1.2), three different media have been used for this purpose. Initially, surface temperatures calculated on a piece of Teflon were compared to the surface temperatures measured by the IR sensor. In this case, all the parameters of the model are either well established in the literature (Mohsenin, 1980) or have been determined by the authors during previous separate experiments. Values of the parameters determined by the authors are: h=150 W m−2 K−1, ɛ=0.96, λ=0.23 W m−1 K−1, D t=1.04×10−7 m2 s−1. The model has a mechanistic basis, and parameter estimates follow from independent experiments. The mean differences between the predicted and experimental results is 0.7 °C under static as well as under very fast dynamic conditions showing in this case the good predictive power of this approach (Fig. 3 ). The model is also able to yield access to the difference in temperature between the surface of the sample and the area, which is located just under this surface.", "id": 990, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Escherichia coli?", "synonym_description": "Escherichia coli is also known as E. coli.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [272], "text": ["80°C"]}, "context": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important intermediate in anaerobic carbon fixation pathways in acetogenesis and methanogenesis. In addition, some anaerobes can utilize CO as an energy source. In the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus, which grows optimally at 80°C, CO oxidation and energy conservation is accomplished by a respiratory complex encoded by a 16-gene cluster containing a CO dehydrogenase, a membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase and a Na+/H+ antiporter module. This complex oxidizes CO, evolves CO2 and H2, and generates a Na+ motive force that is used to conserve energy by a Na+-dependent ATP synthase. Herein we used a bacterial artificial chromosome to insert the 13.2 kb gene cluster encoding the CO-oxidizing respiratory complex of T. onnurineus into the genome of the heterotrophic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, which grows optimally at 100°C. P. furiosus is normally unable to utilize CO, however, the recombinant strain readily oxidized CO and generated H2 at 80°C.", "id": 244, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Thermococcus onnurineus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "342948+Thermococcus onnurineus"}

Nevertheless, these wild-type thermoactive enzymes have relatively low catalytic efficiency (k cat /k m ) and isomerization rate that limit their commercial use. Briefly for industrial application, a GI should have relatively acidic pH optimum, an elevated optimal temperature and a higher affinity for glucose [5]. In the continuing search for a novel glucose isomerase with suitable properties for 55-HFCS production, we studied a GI from the thermophilic anaerobic Caldicoprobacter algerensis. This bacterium was isolated from the hydrothermal hot spring of Gulema in the northeast of Algeria and it had an optimal growth temperature of 65 °C [21]. In this issue, we report the identification of xylACA gene encoding for a novel thermostable and efficient class II GI from Caldicoprobacter algeriensis (GICA). Furthermore, the xylACA was cloned and successfully expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and its biochemical properties and kinetic parameters were investigated. Moreover, we tried to deeply understanding the molecular determinants responsible of its promising catalytic properties by a comparative molecular modeling analysis. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals, vectors, enzymes and bacterial strains All reagents used were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Bio Basic INC, Labo chemie and BioMatik.

E. coli strains were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium which supplemented when necessary with ampicillin (100 μgmL−1) and IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalacto-pyranoside). LB medium agar supplemented with ampicillin (100 μgmL−1) and IPTG (160 μgmL−1) was used in screening plates. 2.2 Amplification of xyl ACA gene In order to amplify xylACA gene, two oligonucleotides primers Xyl-F (AGAAAGGAGAGTGTACTATATGGC) and Xyl-R (GGTAACGCTCATTTAACA TTTAGCAG) were designed based on its nucleic acid sequence obtained from the functional annotation result. The genomic DNA was extracted as described by Bouanane-Darenfed et al. [21]. The PCR reaction, containing Pfu DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 10 pmol of each primer and 200 ng DNA of Caldicoprobacter algeriensis as template, was carried out in a Gene Amp®PCR System 2700 (Applied Biosystems).

It consists of four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 64, 27, 14 and 15kDa, corresponding to SdhA (flavoprotein), SdhB (iron-sulfur protein), SdhC and SdhD (membrane anchor proteins), respectively. The existence of [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters within the purified protein was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy which also revealed a previously unnoticed influence of the substrate on the signal corresponding to the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The enzyme contains two heme b cofactors of reduction midpoint potentials of -20mV and -160mV for bH and bL, respectively. Circular dichroism and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme forms a trimer with a predominantly helical fold. The optimum temperature for succinate dehydrogenase activity is 70°C, which is in agreement with the optimum growth temperature of T. thermophilus. Inhibition studies confirmed sensitivity of the enzyme to the classical inhibitors of the active site, as there are sodium malonate, sodium diethyl oxaloacetate and 3-nitropropionic acid.

To determine chemotaxonomical markers, a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of P. entomophila L48T and its closely related type strains was performed at Anagnosteg GmbH (Germany) [8] as described by Scotta et al. [20]. The profile of peaks obtained for each species was analysed and compared using the software BGP database available at the website http://sourceforge.net/projects/bgp. A dendrogram was generated using the Permutmatrix programme, applying average linkage method (UPGMA hierarchical clustering) and Pearson's distance correlation [1]. The duplicate or quadruplicate whole cell spectra profiles for each strain analysed clustered at least with a 60% similarity. Spectra of two different type strains were less than 50% similar. In the MALDI-TOF MS analysis P. entomophila L48T showed twenty-two single m/z peaks (supermass values) not present in the other strains. These data further support the conclusion that P. entomophila strain L48T is a distinct species and is separate from all other Pseudomonas species, even at the level of expression of the most abundant cellular proteins as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. Additionally, gas chromatography of cell fatty acids methyl esters composition (CFA) was determined at the CCUG (Culture collection, University of Göteborg, Sweden) using a standardized protocol, similar to that of the MIDI Scherlock MIS system (http://www.ccug.se/pages/CFAmethod2008.pdf). Major CFAs for strain L48T were C16:0 (25.1%), C16:1 w7c (14.7%), C17:0 CYCLO (13.1%); the summed feature 2 (C18:1 w7c/12t/9t; 12.2%), C10:0 3-OH (9.4%), C12:0 2-OH (6.8%), C12:0 3-OH (5%); and the unidentified CFA with ECL 10.651 (4.4%); all other detected CFAs values were less than 2.0%. Comparative results for close related Pseudomonas type strains are given in Supplementary Table S5.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [2741], "text": ["25 °C"]}, "context": "Moreover Chlamydomonas applanata did not show growth in acidic condition and exhibited maximum growth at pH 7.4 [46]. Low pH condition limits the nutrient uptake which leads to the reduction of photosynthetic ability thereby decreasing the accumulation of total carbon and evolution of oxygen [47]. Acidic conditions also induce metal toxicity which in turn affects the growth and development of various algae including Chlamydomonas acidophila and Chlorella species [19]. In acidic conditions (pH4.4) hydrogen ions denature certain proteolytic enzymes such as V-lysin which facilitates releasing of daughter cells from within the parental wall [19,48]. Similarly C. vulgaris exhibits growth in extreme acidic environments such as pH of 3.0 with altered biochemical modifications [49]. The energy required to maintain internal pH in these acid-tolerant algae is conserved and maintained through cellular metabolism. This is one of the reason that algal growth is not drastically affected under acidic conditions [50]. Dunaliella acidophila adapts to low pH conditions in growth media by accumulating glycerol to prevent the osmotic imbalance [51]. In extent certain algal species accumulate more saturated fatty acids and storage lipids such as triacylglycerides (TG) to tolerate acidic conditions [52]. Similarly at pH 8.0, C. minutum displayed moderate growth and produced more H2 when compared to C. reinhardtii (Fig. 5). Guan et al. [53] reported that optimal hydrogen was produced at pH 8.0 in Platymonas subcordiformis. Alkaline conditions also limit the availability of nutrients, specifically carbon from CO2 and suppresses the process of photosynthesis [43,54]. On the other hand in higher pH, carbon is available in the form of bicarbonates. Hence affinity of algae towards free CO2 decreases under high pH conditions [54,55]. Alkaline condition also modifies the plasma membrane moiety that suppresses the algal growth. Moreover alkaline pH prevents the rupture of cell wall of mother cells and inhibits autospore release, thus prolongs the time for cell cycle completion [19,56]. Overall this data concludes that both pH 6.0 and 8.0 are also favorable for growth as well for H2 production apart from productive neutral pH condition in C. minutum. Effect of temperature on hydrogen production in C. minutum Generally optimum temperature range observed was between 20 and 40 °C for growth of different algal species based on the literature with some exceptions. In the present study, algal cultures were stirred under continuous light at temperatures of 15 °C, 25 °C and 35 °C simultaneously and observed the growth and development of C. minutum and C. reinhardtii. The most suitable temperature for growth of both the species was 25 °C but H2 production in C. minutum was high when compared to C. reinhardtii (Fig. 6 ). Temperature optima for H2 output has been found to vary significantly depending on alga. Chlorella vulgaris exhibits more growth above 30 °C [57]. For Scenedesmus and Nostoc muscorum the optimum temperature is around 40 °C, whereas for Spirulina it is between 20 and 40 °C. Chlostridium and Platymonas subcordiformis exhibits better growth at 37 °C and 27 °C respectively [19,58–60]. At 15 °C temperature normal growth was not found in agreement with Vonshak and Torzillo [61]. It has been suggested that changes in cytoplasmic viscosity under low temperature condition is responsible for less efficient carbon utilization and reduced electron transport at a given photon flux rate [62]. At low temperature, Dunaliella salina exhibited increase in fatty acid unsaturation, altered fluidity of cell membrane and considerable impact on efficiency of photosynthetic machinery [63]. Moreover at 35 °C temperature, there was significant decrease in growth and H2 output was noticed in both the species (Fig. 6). Though overall growth was diminished at 35 °C, comparatively C. minutum proved best with respect to H2 production. Depending on the species, the growth rate alters with increasing temperature i.e. above critical level [64]. In addition certain enzymes may works in ambient temperature, but there is high possibility of modification in activity at high temperature. Higher temperatures reduce protein synthesis, accumulate more free amino acids and consequently decreased growth rate was observed in Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Ulva pertusa [19]. Moreover temperature also exhibits influence on degradation of starch content in Chlorella vulgaris [65]. Two fold increase in total carotenoid content was observed in Chlorococcum sp., by raising the temperature from 20 to 35 °C under nitrogen deprivation conditions [66]. Though equal amount of biomass was maintained in each set of experiment, variation in data was found among different sets of experiments because each set was performed at different time periods.", "id": 948, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii?", "synonym_description": "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is also known as C. reinhardtii.

Two genes encoding AlkB-type alkane hydroxylase homologues, designated alkMa and alkMb, have been shown to be involved in the degradation of n-alkanes with chain lengths of from 10 to 20 C atoms in this strain. Here, we describe a novel high-throughput screening method and the screening of a transposon mutant library to identify genes involved in the degradation of n-alkanes with C chain lengths longer than 20, which are solid at 30°C, the optimal growth temperature for Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 17874.

For 23 such mutants isolated, the genes inactivated by transposon insertion were identified. Targeted inactivation and complementation studies of one of these genes, designated almA and encoding a putative flavin-binding monooxygenase, confirmed its involvement in the strain's metabolism of long-chain n-alkanes. To our knowledge, almA represents the first cloned gene shown to be involved in the bacterial degradation of long-chain n-alkanes of 32 C's and longer.", "id": 254, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Acinetobacter sp.?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "472+Acinetobacter sp."}

{"answers": {"answer_start": [476], "text": ["75°C"]}, "context": "The thermophilic lipid candidates, in addition to the archaeal ether lipids, are the chemically stable monobranched fatty alcohol-containing diether lipids (Figure 1(f), Thermodesulfobacterium commune (optimum growth temperature: 70°C [8]) and Aquifex pyrophilus (85°C [9]); long chain dicarboxylic fatty acids (diabolic acid, Figure 1(m)) and 15,16-dimethyl 30-glyceryloxytriacontanoic acid (Figure 1(g)) from Thermotoga maritima (90°C [10]) and Fervidobacterium islandicum (75°C [11]); a long chain 1, 2-diol (Figure 1(h), (*Long chain diol lipid: in this lipid it can be considered that the first three carbons, C1 to C3, play the role of the backbone (instead of glycerol) of the lipid. The OH at the C1 may bind a polar head group and the OH at the C2 binds the first hydrocarbon chain, and the C3 and C4 represent a C–C-bond between the “backbone” and the remainder part of the long chain.)) from Thermomicrobium roseum (75°C [12]); cyclohexyl fatty acid (Figure 1(n)) from Bacillus acidocaldarius (65°C [13]). These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5]. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (65°C) has both archaeol- and caldarchaeol-based lipids, while the mesophilic species of Methanobacterium (37°C) has almost the same core lipid composition. Similarly, some archaea that have caldarchaeol-based (tetraether-type) polar lipids in addition to archaeol-based polar lipids grow above 85°C, and there is one that grows at 20°C. Some archaea have only archaeol-based (diether-type) polar lipids and grow below 40°C, yet there is one that grows at 90°C. The hyperthermophilic Methanopyrus kandleri (90°C [5]) has also only diether-type polar lipids.", "id": 17, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Fervidobacterium islandicum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "2423+Fervidobacterium islandicum"}

Comparisons of the RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) gene additionally indicated that all four strains from this study comprised a cluster distinct from other characterized species with the closest relative being Acidovorax sp. JHL-3 (Appendix Fig. A.1). Characterization Isolated Acidovorax strains grew well on common, complex growth media including NA and R2A with colonies generally appearing within 24–48h. Colonies on NA plates grown for 48h for each of the strains were pale yellow to yellow in color (cream to pale yellow on R2A plates), circular and convex with entire margins, and up to 1.0–1.5mm in diameter. Addition of indole to plates resulted in purple colonies for each strain, indicating the probable production of indigo from an active aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase that catalyzes the initial step of aerobic bacterial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation [17]. Growth was observed for all four stains at temperatures tested between 15°C and 35°C, with optimal growth at 30–32.5°C for all strains. Weak growth was observed after two weeks of incubation at 4°C, 37°C, and 40°C in regions of the plates with the densest inoculum for all strains but P4, which did not grow at 40°C. All strains grew at pH 6.0–8.0, with optimal growth at either 7.0 or 7.5. In addition, strain NA3T grew weakly at pH 5.5 and strains P3 and P4 at pH 8.5. All strains grew optimally without amended salt but could tolerate 1% NaCl; no growth was observed after 24h in media supplemented with 2–5% NaCl. No growth was observed under anaerobic conditions on the media tested. All subsequent tests were generally conducted in media at a pH of 7.5, a temperature of 30 or 32.5°C, and with no amended salt. Under scanning electron microscopy, all four strains were observed to be slightly-curved or straight rods without distinguishing external features (Fig. 2 ).

A feathering of growth radiating from each stab indicated motility for all strains. Single, polar flagella were subsequently detected on cells extracted from those stabs (Appendix Fig. A.2).

Here we describe the DNA sequence and characterization of a 19,167-bp circular plasmid, designated pBM19, isolated from B. methanolicus MGA3. Sequence analysis of pBM19 demonstrated the presence of the methanol dehydrogenase gene, mdh, which is crucial for methanol consumption in this bacterium. In addition, five genes (pfk, encoding phosphofructokinase; rpe, encoding ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase; tkt, encoding transketolase; glpX, encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; and fba, encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase) with deduced roles in methanol assimilation via the ribulose monophosphate pathway are encoded by pBM19. A shuttle vector, pTB1.9, harboring the pBM19 minimal replicon (repB and ori) was constructed and used to transform MGA3. Analysis of the resulting recombinant strain demonstrated that it was cured of pBM19 and was not able to grow on methanol. A pTB1.9 derivative harboring the complete mdh gene could not restore growth on methanol when it was introduced into the pBM19-cured strain, suggesting that additional pBM19 genes are required for consumption of this carbon source. Screening of 13 thermotolerant B. methanolicus wild-type strains showed that they all harbor plasmids similar to pBM19, and this is the first report describing plasmid-linked methylotrophy in any microorganism.

Its optimum growth conditions are ∼50 °C and pH 1.8 but it grows well at lower temperatures and it can oxidise both reduced iron and sulfur species. The presence of complex organic compounds such as yeast extract or peptone enhanced growth, compared with growth on inorganic substrates alone (Tsaplina et al., 1991). However, mixotrophic growth does not necessarily confer greater tolerance to all organic compounds. For example, carboxylates and sugars did not enhance S. thermosulfidooxidans growth rates and may have slightly inhibited them.

In batch cultures at pH 7.0, M. mazei LYC grew as aggregates during the early growth stage. As the batch culture began exponential growth, the cell aggregates spontaneously dispersed: the culture liquid became turbid, and myriads of tiny (diameter, 1 to 3 μm) coccoid units were observed under phase-contrast microscopy. Disaggregation apparently was accomplished by the production of an enzyme which hydrolyzed the heteropolysaccharide component of the cell wall; the enzyme was active on other Methanosarcina strains as well. Although the enzyme was active when tested at pH 6.0, it apparently was not produced at that pH: when strain LYC was grown at pH 6.0, only cell aggregates were present throughout batch growth.

Thus, accumulation of molinate-sulfoxide in the treated water should be avoided since it has been reported as being more persistent and more toxic to animals than molinate (Golovleva et al., 1981; Jewell et al., 1999). In the present study, molinate-sulfoxide, molinate-sulfone and alcohol-molinate were not detected (detection limit of 0.025mgl−1) in any organic extract of the cultures grown at different temperatures, whereas 2-oxo-molinate was detected in the organic extracts of cultures grown at 15, 30 and 35°C, in concentrations below 0.050mgl−1. These results suggest that the organic compounds that most contributed to the residual DOC values obtained by the end of growth phase (around 35–40mgl−1) were those released by cell lysis, although it could not be excluded the hypothesis of being products of direct molinate degradation not detected by the methodology used (HPLC/UV). In a previous study (Barreiros et al., 2003), it was shown that in culture DC (mixture of five isolates, ON1–ON5), isolate ON4 is the first organism attacking molinate, with the release of metabolites such as ethanethiol and possibly N-carboxy hexamethyleneimine. Ethanetiol is not further metabolised by strain ON4, being consumed by other members of culture DC, while the last compound supports the growth of several members, including of isolate ON4.

Rt8.G4 (optimum growth temperature 68°C), the mesophile Zymomonas mobilis (optimum growth temperature 32°C) and a second, unidentified, soil mesophile designated unid A (optimum growth temperature 27°C). The kinetic behaviour with temperature of each PGK preparation was distinct, despite the conserved nature of the enzyme. The k(cat) values increased with temperature, but not as rapidly exponentially, as might be expected from the Arrhenius equation. Maximum k(cat) values were at much higher temperatures than the optimum growth temperatures for the mesophiles, but for the thermophile the temperature of maximum k(cat) was close to its optimum growth temperature. K(m) values were in general nearly constant through the lower temperature ranges, but increased substantially as the optimum temperature (highest k(cat)) was passed. Thermal irreversible denaturation of the PGK proteins was also investigated by measuring loss of activity over time. In a dilute buffer, Arrhenius plots for denaturation were linear, and the calculated apparent energy of activation (E(act)) for denaturation for the thermophilic PGK was 600 kJ · mol-1, whereas for the mesophilic enzymes the values were 200-250 kJ mol-1. In the presence of substrates, a considerable stabilization occurred, and in the case of the Z. mobilis enzyme, the apparent E(act) was increased to 480 kJ · mol-1. A theoretical explanation for these observations is presented.

The twofold symmetry axis observed in the dicluster ferredoxins has been lost in the monocluster ferredoxins during evolution (Fig. 3a and c). An alternative evolutionary hypothesis was proposed recently on the basis of the observation that all known ferredoxins from early representatives of different phylogenetic domains contain a single [4Fe–4S] cluster. According to this hypothesis, dicluster ferredoxins have evolved from the monocluster type by the development of a second cluster binding site (Darimont and Sterner, 1994). 3.2.1 The structural basis for ferredoxin thermostability In addition to the ferredoxin structures from two mesophilic (FdDg, FdDa) and one moderately thermophilic organism (FdBt), three ferredoxin structures from hyperthermophilic organisms are available (optimal growth temperature in parenthesis): P. furiosus (100°C), T. litoralis (90°C) and T. maritima (80°C).

Similarly at pH 8.0, C. minutum displayed moderate growth and produced more H2 when compared to C. reinhardtii (Fig. 5). Guan et al. [53] reported that optimal hydrogen was produced at pH 8.0 in Platymonas subcordiformis. Alkaline conditions also limit the availability of nutrients, specifically carbon from CO2 and suppresses the process of photosynthesis [43,54]. On the other hand in higher pH, carbon is available in the form of bicarbonates. Hence affinity of algae towards free CO2 decreases under high pH conditions [54,55]. Alkaline condition also modifies the plasma membrane moiety that suppresses the algal growth. Moreover alkaline pH prevents the rupture of cell wall of mother cells and inhibits autospore release, thus prolongs the time for cell cycle completion [19,56]. Overall this data concludes that both pH 6.0 and 8.0 are also favorable for growth as well for H2 production apart from productive neutral pH condition in C. minutum. Effect of temperature on hydrogen production in C. minutum Generally optimum temperature range observed was between 20 and 40 °C for growth of different algal species based on the literature with some exceptions. In the present study, algal cultures were stirred under continuous light at temperatures of 15 °C, 25 °C and 35 °C simultaneously and observed the growth and development of C. minutum and C. reinhardtii. The most suitable temperature for growth of both the species was 25 °C but H2 production in C. minutum was high when compared to C. reinhardtii (Fig. 6 ). Temperature optima for H2 output has been found to vary significantly depending on alga. Chlorella vulgaris exhibits more growth above 30 °C [57]. For Scenedesmus and Nostoc muscorum the optimum temperature is around 40 °C, whereas for Spirulina it is between 20 and 40 °C.

It is not clear if they grew on either the aliphatic or the aromatic fraction of oil, or both. Some Paecilomyces strains are resistant to heavy metals, and lead tolerant Paecilomyces species have been used in bioremediation studies for the biosorption of heavy metals (Wise, 1997). Although Paecilomyces spp. are deuteromycetes and do not belong to the group of white-rot fungi, it is worth mentioning that some strains are able to degrade lignin and lignin-related aromatic compounds as well (Kluczek-Turpeinen et al., 2003). A strain of Paecilomyces, isolated from a coastal marine environment and identified at the genus level, was able to grow on n-alkylbenzenes provided that the side chain contained at least four carbons (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). It could not grow on benzene, toluene or ethylbenzene. The transient accumulation and subsequent removal of benzoic and phenyl acetic acids suggests that Paecilomyces strain initially attacked the n-alkyl side chain and also metabolized the aromatic ring (Fedorak and Westlake, 1986). The P. variotii strain isolated in our laboratory used toluene as sole carbon and energy source in a mineral medium, with production of carbon dioxide. Our on-going studies indicate that it is unable to metabolize benzene, ethylbenzene or xylenes as single substrates. Toluene was degraded with ammonium as nitrogen source but not with nitrate. No transient accumulation of intermediate products was detected in that strain. Biodegradation of alkylbenzenes does usually start with the hydroxylation of the side chain. Biodegradation of benzene, without any side chain, has not been detected in Paecilomyces strains. Nevertheless, P. lilanicus SBUG-M 1093 was recently shown to partly metabolize biphenyl, a molecule containing two benzene rings without any side-chain, by a first hydroxylation step of one of the benzene rings to form 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybiphenyls (Gesell et al., 2001). Some Paecilomyces strains are thermotolerant and may grow at temperatures above 45–50°C. However, our P. variotii strain could not assimilate toluene at such high temperatures. Either Paecilomyces may grow in the form of pellets or its growth may be characterized by a typical filamentous hyphal aspect (Sinha et al., 2001). It was observed that in Paecilomyces japonica the formation of pellets rather than free mycelia is favoured by high aeration and optimal substrate concentration, as well as mild agitation in aqueous phase (Sinha et al., 2001). Paecilomyces spp. are normally not considered as pathogens and are seldom responsible for human infections, although they may occasionally be involved in mycosis in immunosuppressed patients. 3.5 Cladosporium spp. Although the growth on volatile aliphatic hydrocarbons as n-alkanes by deuteromycetes belonging to the genus Cladosporium was reported several years ago (Siporin and Cooney, 1975; Lindley and Heydeman, 1983, 1986), the isolation and detailed study of strains growing on aromatic pollutants is much more recent. Several years ago, it was mentioned that Cladosporium sphaerospermum ATCC 22711 exhibited a low growth on benzene as well as o- and m-xylenes, although no further information was given (Cofone et al., 1973). More recently, similar results were obtained with C. sphaerospermum ATCC 200384, exhibiting a limited growth on benzene at room temperature between pH 3.5 and 6.5 (Qi et al., 2002). That strain could also grow on toluene and ethylbenzene. No data were reported for the xylene isomers. The levels of biodegradation and/or mineralization were not evaluated in any of those experiments. A few years ago, a strain of C. sphaerospermum was isolated from a gas-phase biofilter treating toluene-polluted air (Weber et al., 1995). When grown in static-liquid medium in presence of about 40μmol toluene, the fungus started degrading the carbon source after a lag phase of about one week. More than 60% of the substrate was recovered as carbon dioxide, while approximatly 30–40% was calculated to be converted to biomass (Prenafeta-Boldú et al., 2001).

A. thiooxydans T is also a moderate osmophile, since growth in liquid media required an external osmotic potential of 2 bar, and was optimal at 5 bar. As a reference, typical culture medium for acidophiles has an osmotic potential of ∼2 bars when amended with 4 g/L ferrous iron sulfate. The addition of magnesium sulfate to 100 mM, increases it to ∼4.6 bars. This becomes critical in elemental sulfur amended cultures, where Acidiferrobacter strains do not grow well, unless magnesium sulfate is added. Under these conditions, a medium with 100 mM magnesium sulfate possess an osmotic potential of ∼2.8 bars.

These beetles lay their eggs along tunnels in xylem sapwood, which is the substrate for fungal growth. Symbiotic fungi of the genus Raffaelea found in invasive and indigenous ambrosia beetles include the highly virulent plant pathogen Raffaelea lauricola affecting members of the Lauraceae family. R. lauricola is responsible for the deaths of > 500 million trees since 2005. Infection by as few as 100 spores can kill a healthy tree within months. Our data show that R. lauricola is cold-adapted with optimal growth between 16 and 26 °C, with little to no growth at temperatures ≥ 30 °C. The fungus is halophilic and shows a dramatic decrease in growth at pH ≥ 6.8. Fungicide resistance profiling revealed sensitivity of R. lauricola to prochloraz, dichlorofluanid, most conazoles, dithiocarbamates, and zineb (zinc fungicide), whereas the related species Raffaelea arxii showed more limited fungicide sensitivity. Entomopathogenic fungi potentially useful for beetle control were generally highly resistant to most fungicides tested. Coupling pH decreased the concentration for 95% inhibition of fungal growth (IC95) of the most potent R. lauricola fungicides by 3–4-fold. Use of avocado bark plug insect bioassays revealed that commercially available Beauveria bassiana can be used as a biological control agent capable of effectively killing the beetle vectors.

These have been assumed to be thermophilic lipids because of their thermostability (unhydrolyzability) (diether or C–C bond in the long-chain diol or membrane-spanning nature (dicarboxylic acid) like tetraether lipids). As a matter of fact, all the thermophilic archaea possess ether lipids, but not all of the organisms possessing the so-called “thermophilic” lipids shown above are themselves thermophilic. The same structure of diabolic acid was also found in Butyrivibrio sp. (39°C [14]); and cyclohexyl fatty acid in Curtobacterium pusillum (27°C [15]). Many species of the mesophilic methanoarchaea [5] have ether core lipids. On the other hand, some of the thermophilic organisms are able to survive with ester lipids in their membranes [10–13].Because tetraether type, membrane-spanning polar lipids (Figures 1(d) or 1(e)) were first found in thermoacidophilic archaeon [16], these lipids are considered thermophilic lipids. Tetraether lipids are extended as a result of their C40 hydrocarbon chains passing across the membrane bilayer. Thus, tetraether lipids link the leaflets of the lipid bilayer covalently and thus make the membrane rigid. This structure allows membranes to tolerate extreme conditions. However, some of the nonthermophilic methanoarchaea have the same tetraether lipids [5]. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (65°C) has both archaeol- and caldarchaeol-based lipids, while the mesophilic species of Methanobacterium (37°C) has almost the same core lipid composition. Similarly, some archaea that have caldarchaeol-based (tetraether-type) polar lipids in addition to archaeol-based polar lipids grow above 85°C, and there is one that grows at 20°C.

In fact, it was determined that the most important parameter on the growth rate of this species is temperature, with the faster growth at 37 °C (Alonso et al., 2017). This temperature corresponds to the maximum temperature (average of maximum temperatures 26.7 °C) reached in summer in the region where samples were taken (Fig. S1).

The cat presented otalgia and erythema, hyperplasia of the ear canals, pruritus and a dark secretion with a characteristic odour. Samples were obtained by sterile swab from both ear canals.

All slides were examined at 1000× magnification (high power under oil immersion). This technique allows for microscopic visualization of any microorganisms that reside within the ear canal cerumen, and a minimum number of yeast cells per oil immersion field (>5yeast/field) indicates excessive colonization by the organism (i.e., infection).

The organism has also been isolated from man-made thermal habitats, such as hot tap water, in geographical locations quite distant from thermal springs. Isolates of T. aquaticus are gram-negative nonsporulating nonmotile rods which frequently form long filaments at supraoptimal temperatures or in the stationary phase. All isolates form a yellow cellular pigment, probably a carotenoid. A characteristic structure formed by all isolates is a large sphere, considerably larger than a spheroplast. These large spheres, as well as lysozyme-induced spheroplasts, are resistant to osmotic lysis. Deoxyribonucleic acid base compositions of four strains were determined by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation and found to be between 65.4 and 67.4 moles per cent guanine plus cytosine. The growth of all isolates tested is inhibited by fairly low concentrations of cycloserine, streptomycin, penicillin, novobiocin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Nutritional studies on one strain showed that it did not require vitamins or amino acids, although growth was considerably faster in enriched than in synthetic medium.

The activation energy of this microorganism was lower at 26 to 35°C than at 15 to 22°C. On the basis of the Arrhenius law, growth rate, maximum population density, and cell yield models have been developed by introducing the different activation energy (E(infa)) values. According to the model, optimal conditions were 35°C, pH 6.5, and 0% (vol/vol) ethanol for the growth rate. For cell density and cell yield, optimal conditions were 32°C, pH 6.0, and 1% (vol/vol) ethanol. No growth was observed for ethanol concentrations above 8% and pH values below 4.0. Other equations have also been made to describe the major end products fermented during fermentation by a Pectinatus sp.

The growth rates of U. pertusa and H. akashiwo and the rate of microalgal growth inhibition were altered significantly by changing some of the non-nutrient factors in both the single-factor and the two-factor experiments. The optimal growth conditions for U. pertusa were 20-25°C, salinity of 30 g kg-1, irradiance level of 200-400 μmol m-2 s-1, and pH 8.5-10; optimal conditions for H. akashiwo growth were 25°C, 30 g kg-1, 100 μmol m-2 s-1 and pH 8.5, respectively.

With mixed bacteria of equal volume and a culture medium, the oil samples from five wells of the reservoir are fermented on a table vibrator at 48°C in 48 hr and the following results are obtained: decrease in oil viscosity by 26-65%, lowering surface tension of fermentation liquor by 10-19%, and change of liquor pH value from neutral to slightly acidic. The last two phenomena indicate creation of some surfactants and acids during oil fermentation. The field trial bacterial treatments are performed 7 well-times in 5 wells at block Leng-43 with the same pay zones and of low productivity in cyclic steam stimulations.

However, Werts et al. (23) reported that L. interrogans LPS instead activates TLR2. It is tempting to speculate that the apparent differences in TLR activation between L. interrogans and E. coli are due to the structural characteristics of their respective lipid A molecules. Identification of the L. interrogans genes and enzymes responsible for some of these structural variations should provide helpful tools for investigating this hypothesis. Here, it is reported that a novel L. interrogans membrane enzyme, designated LmtA, catalyzes the selective transfer of a methyl group in vitro from SAM to the 1-phosphate residue of Kdo2-lipid A. When LmtA is expressed in E. coli, a modified lipid A species is synthesized in vivo, which is shown to be the 1-phosphomethyl derivative of E. coli lipid A. Lipid A methylation probably occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, since it is independent of MsbA function. The addition of the methyl group to E. coli lipid A does not alter its potent, TLR4-specific bioactivity.

Highly thermostable lipases are mostly produced by thermophilic bacteria, although some mesophilic bacteria like Burkholderia cepacia [14], Pseudomonas [15,16], and Amycolatopsis mediterranei [17], have also been reported to produce thermostable enzymes, including a hyperthermophilic enzyme from Pseudomonas [18]. Despite the large number of microbial lipases identified, cloned, and characterized to date, they are still narrowed to a small portion of the microbial diversity. Scarce information concerning the lipases of the genus Janibacter is available. A few strains have been isolated from different environments and have shown lipolytic activity [19,20]. Recently, a mono and di-acyl glycerol lipase MAJ1 from Janibacter HTCC2649, belonging to Family I.7, has been isolated and characterized. The optimum activity of this enzyme occurred at pH 7.0 and 30°C, and it retained 50% of the optimum activity at 5°C, indicating that MAJ1 is a cold-active lipase [21]. Janibacter strains are halotolerant microorganisms [22,23], and thus, they can constitute a source of halophilic enzymes. In addition to thermostable lipases, halophilic enzymes are also interesting for biotechnological applications [24]. Their ability to work in the presence of low water activity could be useful in harsh industrial environments where enzymatic reactions need to be carried out in organic solvents or in the presence of other chemicals. Janibacter sp. strain R02 (BNM 560) was previously isolated in our laboratory from an Antartic soil sample. A remarkable trait of this strain was its high extracellular lipolytic activity, thus being a good candidate for lipase prospection. Herein we describe the identification, cloning, expression and characterization of a novel esterase, LipJ2, from Janibacter sp. R02. This enzyme displays an optimal temperature of 80°C, being extremely thermostable. In addition, it is alkalophilic and halophilic, constituting the first report of an extremophilic enzyme described from the genus Janibacter. The discovery of LipJ2 and the knowledge of its particular characteristics, along with a phylogenetic and structural analysis, provided evidence to propose the existence of a new family of bacterial lipases. Following the criteria and the nomenclature established by Arpigny and Jaeger [1], LipJ2 would be the first member assigned to a newly proposed bacterial lipase family designated as family XVII [25,26]. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Strains and growth conditions Janibacter sp. R02 was isolated from an Antarctic soil sample. Lipolyitic activity was assayed in Rhodamine-Olive Oil plates and by hydrolysis of triolein with the extracellular enzyme fraction. Identification of the strain was performed by physiological test and 16S rRNA sequencing. Growth curves were performed in TSB, at 150rpm, at 20, 28 and 35°C respectively, and the optimal growth temperature was determined to be 28°C. The strain was routinely grown in Tryptic Soy (TSA) agar plates at 28°C for 24h and in TSB broth at 28°C and 150rpm for 48h. The original strain was kept frozen at −70°C in TSB supplemented with 15% glycerol.", "id": 1110, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Caldanaerobacter subterraneus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "911092+Caldanaerobacter subterraneus"}

In the second stage (STR), the growth of Leptospirillum ferriphilum was favoured, since only this strain was detected on the fingerprints in the pulp, on the solid phase and in the liquid phase. Despite the fact that Acidithiobacillus caldus and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans were known to be members of BRGM-KCC consortium inoculated into the bioreactor, they remained undetected. For Acidithiobacillus caldus, which is a sulphur-oxidizing bacterium, this can be explained by the absence of reduced sulphur compounds in the bioreactor. Likewise, the temperature maintained at 35 °C in the bioreactor was probably too low for Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans since the optimum growth temperature is 51 °C for this bacterium [51]. Since most of the cells were attached to the PCBs, SEM was used to correlate the presence of attached cells with the composition of the solid phase (Fig. 12 ). Ten PCB fragments were observed. On some fragments, which were probably glass or ceramic fibres made up of Al, Si and Ca (Fig. 12A), there was little or no bacteria. Round and organic elements appeared to be attached between some fibres (Fig. 12B). A wire linked these elements to the PCB fragment but broke under the electron beam. These elements may be cells that formed spores to protect themselves from their environment: the genus Sulfobacillus is able to sporulate for example [29,51].

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "In our laboratory, enzymes responsible for trehalose synthesis were purified from Sulfolobus shibatae DSM 5389. They were named trehalosyl dextrins forming enzyme (TDFE) and trehalose forming enzyme (TFE) and were characterized from a chemico-physical and a kinetic viewpoint. They were found to be very similar to the ones isolated from other Sulfolobales. In addition, the kinetic of conversion of maltoheptaose to trehalose was investigated, determining intermediates and products using HPLC [41]. Table 2 consists of a comparison of the characteristics of the enzymes. Almost contemporary, similar biocatalytic activities were found in Sulfolobus solfataricus MT4 (optimal growth temperature, 87°C). These enzymes showed a high thermostability and seemed suitable to develop a novel bioprocess for trehalose production. To make feasible the industrial application of these enzymes it was necessary to develop a production process at low cost and to improve the stability of biocatalysts. The production of TDFE and TFE from the wild-type strain was very expensive owing to the low biomass yield typical of extremophilic microorganism cultivation, therefore they were expressed into mesophilic host [42] and produced at high yield in a microfiltration bioreactor [43]. By exploiting the thermostability of the enzymes of interest a quick two-step purification procedure was used consisting of a heat treatment that caused the selective precipitation of the host proteins followed by a chromatographic step on a sephacryl S-200 column. Recently, to improve the coupling of the two catalytic activities of interest, the coding sequences of TFE and TDFE were fused to obtain a new chimeric protein able to convert dextrins to trehalose at high temperature (75°C) by sequential enzymatic steps [44]. Glucosyltransferase catalyzing an intramolecular transglycosylation to produce α,α-trehalose A trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.16) was purified from a cell-free extract of Pimelobacter sp. R48 [45]. The enzyme catalyzed a one step conversion of maltose into trehalose by intramolecular transglucosylation as well as the reverse reaction but was inactive on the other saccharides (Fig. 1, type III) [46].

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "A high G/C content in the gene does not provide evidence for the thermostability, since genes with a low GC content also show a high thermostability in Dictyoglomus thermophilum [32]. In comparison of the amino acid composition of T. aquaticus DNA polymerase I (Taq polymerase) with that of E. coli DNA polymerase I, it is interesting to note that the Arg-to-Lys ratio for the T. aquaticus enzyme is nearly twice that of the enzyme from E. coli [33]. Like Taq polymerase, the Arg-to-Lys ratio of AGPase from T. caldophilus GK-24 was higher 32/16 than 32/20 from E. coli [34]. As a result, changes in the P235 and K376 residues of T. caldophilus AGPase may have an influence on not only the thermostability of enzyme but also its controversial allosteric control by PLP and phenyl glyoxal, as has been observed for the E. coli AGPase. Previously, we have purified and characterized the UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase of T. caldophilus, which contains UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase activities [5]. Because bacterial glycogen and plant starch represent very important storage carbohydrates, the physiological need for AGPase might be higher than for other pyrophosphorylases. The position of Asp142 has been reported to be very important for AGPase catalytic activity in E. coli [25]. Moreover, H145 of T. caldophilus AGPase was located near the ATP-binding region, which also contains Y114, a residue that is known to be involved in ATP binding in E. coli. These suggest that H145 of T. caldophilus AGPase may be involved in the binding of ATP. The position of sugar binding in AGPase of T. caldophilus is interesting, considering the previous report that V335 is the amino acids involved in the enzyme regulation, not sugar binding, in E. coli. The three-dimensional structure of any AGPase would be of much help to answer for structure–function relationship. Unfortunately, it is not currently available.

P. entomophila L48T also differed in 10 different phenotypic characteristics with Pseudomonas parafulva DSM 17004T; 14 with P. fulva IAM 1529T, P. putida IAM 1236T, Pseudomonas cremoricolorata DSM 17059T and P. taiwanensis DSM 21245T; 19 with P. plecoglossicida ATCC 700383T; and 20 with P. monteilli ATCC 700476T. To determine chemotaxonomical markers, a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of P. entomophila L48T and its closely related type strains was performed at Anagnosteg GmbH (Germany) [8] as described by Scotta et al. [20]. The profile of peaks obtained for each species was analysed and compared using the software BGP database available at the website http://sourceforge.net/projects/bgp. A dendrogram was generated using the Permutmatrix programme, applying average linkage method (UPGMA hierarchical clustering) and Pearson's distance correlation [1]. The duplicate or quadruplicate whole cell spectra profiles for each strain analysed clustered at least with a 60% similarity. Spectra of two different type strains were less than 50% similar. In the MALDI-TOF MS analysis P. entomophila L48T showed twenty-two single m/z peaks (supermass values) not present in the other strains. These data further support the conclusion that P. entomophila strain L48T is a distinct species and is separate from all other Pseudomonas species, even at the level of expression of the most abundant cellular proteins as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. Additionally, gas chromatography of cell fatty acids methyl esters composition (CFA) was determined at the CCUG (Culture collection, University of Göteborg, Sweden) using a standardized protocol, similar to that of the MIDI Scherlock MIS system (http://www.ccug.se/pages/CFAmethod2008.pdf). Major CFAs for strain L48T were C16:0 (25.1%), C16:1 w7c (14.7%), C17:0 CYCLO (13.1%); the summed feature 2 (C18:1 w7c/12t/9t; 12.2%), C10:0 3-OH (9.4%), C12:0 2-OH (6.8%), C12:0 3-OH (5%); and the unidentified CFA with ECL 10.651 (4.4%); all other detected CFAs values were less than 2.0%. Comparative results for close related Pseudomonas type strains are given in Supplementary Table S5. Considering the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic, genomic and phenotypic characteristics, we propose P. entomophila strain L48T as the type strain of the new species Pseudomonas entomophila sp. nov.

Whereas bacterial NDTs are homohexamers endowed with dihedral D3 molecular symmetry [10], eukaryotic NDTs are homodimers [10]. The basic catalytic unit [12] of all these enzymes is a dimeric assembly where each active site is configured by residues contributed by both polypeptide chains that despite sharing a low level of sequence identity between them their 3D structure is highly conserved. In fact, we reported only minor changes between the architectures of the subunits from dimeric and hexameric NDTs [10]. With the exception of BpNDT, which is produced by the psychrotolerant bacterium B. psychrosaccharolyticus, the other NDTs with known 3D structure described up to now are mesophilic enzymes. In this regard, we found that BpNDT behaves as a mesophilic enzyme with an optimal temperature for activity of 50 °C [7], well above the maximum temperature for bacterial growth (30 °C).", "id": 457, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Chroococcidiopsis thermalis?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "54299+Chroococcidiopsis thermalis"}

However, a single-season experiment is certainly not sufficient for exact prognosis of future trends in pathogen development, especially considering several experimental drawbacks of our approach: Cultured pathogens certainly behave differently to those surviving in soil under true field conditions. A soil warming system close to a building (Siebold and von Tiedemann, 2012b, 2013), but also litterbags (Knacker et al., 2003) have strong microclimatic effects, changing survival and saprotrophic activities of fungi. The same is true for the soil type, where sandy or clayey soils differ in their habitat properties from the current loam. In contrast to F. culmorum, F. graminearum is most common in warm and continental climates (Nielsen et al., 2011; Parikka et al., 2012) and the germination of conidia as well as fungal growth is favoured by warm and humid conditions (Leplat et al., 2013).

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Basically, oxygen supply is not an issue in the air-abundant environment; however its relatively high Henry's law constant might restrain the penetration depth in water compared to that of pollutant, which can produce anaerobic zones in the deeper parts of the biofilm. Although bacteria grow at pH ranging from 5 to 9, the most preferred pH for bacterial activity is between 7 and 8. The stability of this parameter promotes the waste treatment performance (Mudliar et al., 2010), as fluctuations of the pH more than 2–3 units is detrimental for microbial performance. In order to fine-tune the operating conditions the temperature control is crucial in biopurification process to avoid thermal shock in the reaction environment. Hence, we can distinguish three temperature-based classes of aerobic bacteria: psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic, respectively. In fact, most of waste gas treatment processes are performed under mesophilic range (15–40 °C), but the temperatures of industrial off-gases are frequently higher, thus bioreactors operating efficiently under thermophilic conditions (>45 °C) or psychrophilic (<15 °C) were described as well (Easter et al., 2005). For mesophilic bacteria the higher temperature the better growth rate up to an optimum of approximately 37 °C with the recommended working temperature in 20–40 °C range, where biological activity doubles for each 10 °C temperature rise (Mudliar et al., 2010).", "id": 694, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Cedecea davisae?", "synonym_description": "Cedecea davisae is also known as 005.

MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex spectrometer; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was first performed to try to identify the bacterium [10]. In brief, 1.5 μL of matrix solution containing diluted α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 500 μL acetonitrile, 250 μL 10% trifluoroacetic acid and 250 μL HPLC water was deposited on each spot for ionization and crystallization. All protein spectra obtained were compared with those of the MALDI-TOF database. If the score was greater than or equal to 1.9, the strain was considered identified. Otherwise, the identification failed. When MALDI-TOF MS failed, bacterial identification was performed using 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification in combination with sequencing as previously described [11]. Strain ND3T exhibited 92.4% of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Sutterella wadsworthensis strain SW4, which is the phylogenetically closest species with a validly published name [12]. As Stackebrant [13] suggested, if the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity value was lower than 98.7% or 95%, the strain was defined as a new species or genus respectively, without performing DNA-DNA hybridization [14]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from other Sutterellaceae family members.

Emtiazi et al. (2003) studied extra-cellular lipase production by Pseudomonas strain X using CSC. Maximum production of lipase was obtained on CSC (400U/ml) in 50h. Addition of olive oil to pre-culture induced maximum lipase production in 24h. Sunflower oil induced lipase production by 540U/ml and the maximum lipase activity was observed at 60°C (1200U/ml) and at pH 8 (Emtiazi et al., 2003). Another bacterial strain, Bacillus mycoides was identified as lipase producer on COC. The growth of the organism and lipase production was maximum after 72h of incubation under shaking. Olive oil and beef extract were best carbon and nitrogen sources. Na+ induced more lipase than K+ and Mg2+ (Thomas et al., 2003). Production of lipases by Penicillium simplicissimum was studied in SSF using SBC as substrate (Di Luccio et al., 2004). The enriched samples from different oil seed cakes for the isolation of lipolytic fungi by tributyrin agar clearing method and subsequently by cultivating the selected isolates under submerged fermentation conditions and assaying for their extracellular lipase producing capabilities led to identification of a Rhizopus sp. designated as Rhizopus sp.

Mixed substrate fermentation using COC and SOC resulted more than two-fold increase in phytase production under optimised conditions (64U/gds phytase) in comparison to the use of COC and SOC individually (Ramachandran et al., 2005). Phytase production has also been reported with SOC and GOC with Mucor racemosus NRRL 1994. At optimised conditions phytase production reached 44.5U/gds when combination of SOC and wheat bran was used which was almost 4-fold higher than that obtained from wheat bran (Roopesh et al., 2006). CaOC was studied for phytase production with Aspergillus ficuum in a SSF process. Lower concentrations of phosphorus favoured the production of the enzyme. Compared with the control, Tween-80 and sodium oleate increased the rates of phytase production and hydrolysis of phytic acid, while Triton X-100 had a negative effect on these processes (Ebune et al., 1995a). Similarly, effects of moisture content of media, inoculum age and homogenization on production of phytase and reduction of phytic acid content in CaOC by A. ficuum NRRL 3135 during static SSF were investigated. Optimum moisture content of media for these processes was 64%. Rate of phytase production increased with an increase in inoculum age between 2 and 5 days (Ebune et al., 1995b). COC was used for phytase production with R. oligosporus with maximum enzyme production (14.29U/g of dry substrate) occurring at pH 5.3, 30°C, and 54.5% moisture after 96h of incubation. The addition of extra nutrients to the substrate resulted in inhibition of product formation (Sabu et al., 2002). Similarly, phytase production has also been reported using CaOC and COC along with wheat bran using three Mucor and eight Rhizopus strains. M. racemosus gave the highest activity (14.5IU/g dry matter phytase activity) on COC. The optimised supplementation of COC with glucose, casein and (NH4)2SO4 led to increase in phytase production to 26U/g dry matter. Similarly, using optimised medium phytase, α-amylase and lipase production of M. racemosus was compared in solid-state fermentation and in shake flask (SF) fermentation (Bogar et al., 2003).", "id": 1023, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Penicillium restrictum?", "synonym_description": "Penicillium restrictum is also known as P. restrictum.

These values are below the threshold value recommended (<98.7% sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene) by authors to delineate new bacterial species within a genus without performing DNA–DNA hybridization [15,16]. Based on this observation, we declare that these strains are new members of the genus Bacillus belonging to the family Bacillaceae within the phylum Firmicutes (Fig. 2 ). Phenotypic characteristics The strains from Senegal were easily grown in an aerobic atmosphere. Apparent colonies were obtained after 24 h of incubation at 37°C on 5% sheep’s blood–Columbia agar medium (bioMérieux). Strains Marseille-P3515T and Marseille-P3516T were recovered from human stool sample from a Senegalese village named Ndiop. Their colonies appear rounded, beige and shiny with a mean diameter of 1.2 mm. Cells were Gram-positive bacteria, rod-shaped and catalase positive. In addition, the oxidase reaction test was positive for these two strains, which were mobile and spore forming. These strains were cultured on halophilic media with NaCl concentrations of 50, 75, 100 and 150 g/L of NaCl. In parallel, the growth of bacteria was tested on media at different pH (pH 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5 and 8). Tests have shown that the two strains grow better in 48 h at pH 7.5, at 75 g/L of NaCl and 37°C. These data indicate that strains Marseille-P3515T and Marseille-P3516T are halophilic bacteria. Strain Marseille-P2639T was endospore forming and motile. It was a Gram-negative bacterium that exhibited catalase activity. Bacterial cells did not have an oxidase reaction. They measured 3.7 μm in length and 0.8 μm in diameter. Strain Marseille-P2639T was an aerobic bacterium that grew between 23°C and 45°C in <1 day of incubation. Colonies of strain Marseille-P2639T were white with a mean diameter of 3 mm on 5% sheep’s blood-enriched Columbia agar. Strain Marseille-P2639T is a bacterium that weakly tolerates salt concentrations >50 g/L of NaCl but is able to grow on media with a pH ranging from 6 to 10.

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "It is proposed that A. cryptum utilises fungal biomass as an energy source in managed heaps with solution recycle via solvent extraction plants. While it shares the environment with iron- and sulfur-oxidising acidophiles, it does not contribute directly to copper extraction from sulfide minerals. Keywords Bioleaching Ferrous ion oxidation Organic reagents Sulfobacillus Acidiphilium Acidithiobacillus 1 Introduction Heap leaching of copper oxides and secondary copper sulfides is responsible for about 20% of world copper production. Copper is recovered from oxide minerals using a dilute sulfuric acid solution. Sulfide mineral dissolution requires the presence of an oxidant, such as ferric ion, in the acidic solution and is assisted by the presence of acidophilic bacteria and archaea that utilise sulfide minerals as an energy source. About 20 heap bioleaching operations have been commissioned since 1980, initially in Chile but more recently in the Asia-Pacific region (Watling, 2006). In many cases the copper is purified and recovered from solution using solvent extraction and electrowinning technologies. These successful operations demonstrate the robust nature and operational simplicity of mining biotechnology, together with health, safety and environmental benefits, and capital and operating cost advantages. Process waters from heap leach – solvent extraction – electrowinning operations typically contain moderate concentrations of dissolved organic compounds. Some organic compounds become entrained in the aqueous solution during passage of the leach solution through the solvent extraction plant. Bioleaching acidophiles are generally sensitive to organic matter in their environments but the effects of solvent extraction reagents on bacterial growth have not been widely reported, possibly because early results indicated that At. ferrooxidans was not greatly affected by them. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is the most studied of the bioleaching acidophiles and was for many years thought to be the most important contributor to enhanced bioleaching, largely because it flourished in laboratory cultures. It grows well in the pH range 1.8–2.5 and temperature range 30–35 °C with an upper limit at about 40 °C, is tolerant of high base metal concentrations in its environment and oxidises both iron(II) and reduced sulfur compounds to iron(III) and sulfate, respectively (Rawlings, 1997).", "id": 752, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "920+Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans"}

Koeck and colleagues [37]. This thermophilic non-sporulating rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from a thermophilic biogas plant with an optimal growth at 55 °C. Nevertheless, whereas H. hemicellulosilytica T3/55T is registered in the SILVA database both in the data sets of aligned small (SSU) and large (LSU) subunits, at the time of writing, its affiliation according to the LSU database belonged to the genus Herbinix (Lachnospiraceae), while within the SSU database, it was affiliated to the genus Mobilitalea (Lachnospiraceae). Mobilitalea sibirica is absent in the LSU database, and only present in SSU dataset under a self-titled genus name Mobilitalea (Lachnospiraceae). Thus, such discrepancies within the known databases make the proper strain identification and determination of the microbial composition through metagenomic analysis quite sophisticated, particularly when the re-classification of the previously described species is an ongoing process. In the microbial community, the products of the lignocellulolose hydrolysis, such as soluble sugars, alcohol and organic acids, mainly short chain volatile fatty acids, are further metabolized into acetic acid, molecular hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The syntrophic microorganisms are also capable of acetate oxidation into these gaseous products, although only in the case of low H2 partial pressure. Since the free hydrogen should be constantly removed, the most efficient hydrogen utilization and bioconversion in the biogas community happens during the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. According to the HTS analysis, the majority of the methanogens in the tested community are represented by the hydrogenotrophic strains of Methanothermobacter (96%) and only 4% contributes to Methanosarcina, which is capable of using both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways for the methane production. Although the microorganisms, similar by their morphology to the filament-like cells of Methanosaeta, were detected by the light microscopy (Fig. S1), no traces of this acetotrophic methanogen were identified by DGGE or HTS analysis. Interestingly, but only one of the DGGE profiles of the archaeal community corresponded to the HTS results; the presence of Methanothermobacter and Methanosarcina strains were detected when the primer pairs of Arch338F-Arch1381R followed by Arch344F-GC-Arch915R were used, whereas the usage of Univ515F −Arch915R primers revealed an additional representative (according to the NCBI database) of Methanoculleus thermophilus that also performs a hydrogenotrophic type of methanogenesis. The selection of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens over aceticlastic methanogens under the extreme-thermophilic (70 °C) conditions was also shown by F.Zhang and colleagues [41] with the presence of mainly Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus and Methanobacterium thermoaggregans as 98% of Archaea. Although the acetate-oxidizing reactions are energetically unfavourable in comparison to the acetoclastic way of the acetate degradation [42], they were shown to be efficient during the waste-paper bioconversion into biomethane, due to the strong relations between the syntrophic acetate-oxydizing bacteria (SAOB) and methanogenic Archaea. SAOB are known to use H2/CO2 to produce acetate, as well as vice versa, to utilize acetate reversibly [42]. Other authors [43] also reported that in the thermophilic (50–55 °C) anaerobic plug-flow reactor, treating municipal waste under saline conditions, Clostridia (>92%) were still dominating among bacteria, and Methanoculleus (>90%) prevailed among Archaea.", "id": 1135, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Mobilitalea sibirica?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "1462919+Mobilitalea sibirica"}

Here we report the isolation of a new thermophilic, filamentous non-heterocystous cyanobacterium of Leptolyngbya sp. strain O-77 and also describe the characterization of the oxygen-evolving PSII complex from the isolate. Materials and methods Isolation and culture of the strain O-77 In order to isolate the thermophilic cyanobacteria, we collected many samples from hot springs in Aso-Kuju National park, Kumamoto, Japan. Enrichment culture and isolation were carried out in a modified DH + Fe medium containing the following components (per liter): 0.1 g nitrilotriacetic acid, 1.7 g NaNO3, 0.14 g K2HPO4, 0.1 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g CaSO4·2H2O, 0.03 g FeCl3·6H2O, 3.0 mg H3BO3, 2.0 mg MnSO4·H2O, 0.1 mg ZnSO4·7H2O, 75 μg CoCl2·6H2O, 75 μg NiCl2·6H2O, 80 μg CuSO4·5H2O, and 80 μg Na2MoO4·2H2O. The medium was adjusted to pH 7.5 with 0.1 N NaOH. Liquid culture was performed in 500 mL flasks containing 100 mL of the medium on a reciprocal shaker at 150 rpm for 2 weeks at 50°C on continuous illumination (25–30 μmol photon m−2 s−1). After several repetitions of enrichment culture, the culture solution was streaked onto a gellan gum plate. The green filamentous colonies were selected and re-streaked more than 3 times to ensure the purity of the strain O-77. To investigate the optimum growth conditions of the isolated strain O-77, optimal growth temperature and optimal growth pH were determined. Mass culture was performed in a 10 L jar fermentor model MBF-1000ME (EYELA, Tokyo Rikakikai Co., Ltd.) containing 8 L medium under agitation at 150 rpm at 50°C with a 1.0 L/min flow with bubbling of 3% CO2 containing air under white light (40–50 μmol photon m−2 s−1). 16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis Genomic DNA was isolated from late-exponential-phase cells by using an InstaGene kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). To amplify the 16S rRNA gene segments, two sets of cyanobacteria-specific primers were used, as described by Nübel et al. (13). PCR was performed using PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio) with 25 cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 10 s, annealing at 50°C for 5 s and extension at 60°C for 4 min. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The protocols were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The complete sequence (1448 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene from the strain O-77 was deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession number (AB668058). The CLUSTAL_X program (14) was used to align the 16S rRNA gene sequences with related sequences (available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases).

Polar lipids were separated by two-dimensional silica gel TLC. Total lipids were detected using molybdatophosphoric acid, and defined functional groups were detected using spray reagents specific for the groups. Full details are given by Tindall et al. [22]. Results and discussion Both strains were Gram negative, rod-shaped, and motile by one polar flagellum (Fig. S1). Cells of strains P0211T and P0213T were 0.4–0.8μm and 0.3–0.6μm in width, and 0.8–3.6μm and 1.0–4.2μm in length, respectively. Growth of the two strains was found to occur between 15–45°C (optimum 37°C), pH 6.5–8.5 (optimum pH 8.0–8.5), and in the presence of 1.0–7.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.0%).", "id": 888, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Alteromonas macleodii?", "synonym_description": "Alteromonas macleodii is also known as A. macleodii.

However, we have not examined the potential effect of all possible electron acceptors on cytochrome content and distribution in MR-1 cells, so we cannot exclude the possibility that growth with other electron acceptors may result in marked differences from our current findings. In summary, four distinct c-type cytochromes are evident in the OM of anaerobically grown MR-1. These cytochromes are oxidized by oxidized forms of iron and manganese, which have previously been shown to serve as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration in MR-1. The 83-kDa OM cytochrome was purified, and Western blots using specific antisera for this protein demonstrated that the vast majority is localized to the OM and an intermediate density membrane fraction of similar composition. Its specific content is markedly increased by a switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, suggesting that its de novo synthesis is significantly increased under anaerobic conditions. Other studies are currently underway in our lab to discern the in vivo role of these OM cytochromes.

All of them utilized ATP as a cofactor, and all were classified as belonging to the ATP-dependent DNA ligase group. It was presumed that archaeal ligases would exclusively utilize ATP as their nucleotide substrate. This notion was, however, recently challenged by the results of some studies. Interestingly, the ATP-dependent DNA ligase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 manifested a relatively low, but significant, DNA ligase activity, when NAD+ instead of ATP was used as a cofactor (Nakatani et al., 2000). The Tfu DNA ligase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon T. fumicolans was recently demonstrated that the DNA ligase have an ability to use either ATP or NAD+ as a cofactor (Rolland et al., 2004).

It is likely that some of the variability was due to inaccuracies involved in performing cell counts using a phase contrast microscope, although repeated tests have shown that cell counts can be done reproducibly within one third of an order of magnitude. Variations between the proportions of attached and unattached cells probably contribute to variations in total cell counts although very little cell attachment in shake flask cultures was observed. Another possible source of variability is ore heterogeneity which would influence the amount of cell growth depending on the quantity and accessibility of mineral sulfide particles.

Transfer of the IncQ plasmid was dependent upon induction of the virB and virD operons by acetosyringone but was not dependent upon induction of the tra genes by octopine. However, alterations in the level of vir gene induction could not account for the decrease in transfer with increasing temperature. A. tumefaciens did successfully mobilize IncQ plasmids at higher temperatures when alternative transfer machineries were provided. Thus, the defect in transfer at high temperature is apparently in the T-DNA transfer machinery itself. As these data correlate with earlier tumorigenesis studies, we propose that tumor suppression at higher temperatures results from a T-DNA transfer machinery which does not function properly.", "id": 9, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Agrobacterium tumefaciens?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "358+Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}

{"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "For example, the type strain M. bheemlicum JA124T appeared to form a basal branch within cluster I (data not shown). However, this apparent incongruence was solved with the inclusion of one of the following genes: 16S rRNA, gyrB, recA, or the ITS sequence. The influence of each gene and the ITS sequence over the final tree topology was evaluated by comparing the average bootstrap value of seven nodes from trees constructed with different gene combinations. The inclusion of only one gene (e.g. recA, 16S rRNA or gyrB) produced increasing average bootstrap values of 59%, 76% and 88%, respectively, while the inclusion of the ITS sequence alone produced an average value of 78%. Similar to a previous study [34], the stability of tree topologies increased in parallel with the number of concatenated genes (Fig. S11). In our case, a set of seven genes guaranteed a stable topology, which is in agreement with the minimal number of genes recommended for MLSA [9,24]. Discussion The slow evolutionary rate and relative lack of highly resolving informative characters of the 16S rRNA gene has been well documented [19,31]. Due to these inherent structural characteristics, phylogenetic tree reconstructions based on 16S rRNA sequences cannot resolve the taxonomic position of closely related bacterial species. The present study addressed the genus Marichromatium in which all strains except the type strain M. bheemlicum JA124T shared >99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Therefore, they constituted what has been described as a microdiverse ribotype (i.e., a cluster with less than 1% sequence divergence) [1]. In this context, we carried out a multi-gene based phylogenetic analysis. This was even more important since among the examined Marichromatium strains remarkable phenotypic differences were only found for a newly reported strain of M. gracile biotype thermosulfidiphilum DSM 21765 [33]. Notably, this new biotype exhibited a higher optimum growth temperature of 40°C and a higher sulfide tolerance of up to 16mM than the other Marichromatium type strains [33].", "id": 1224, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Marichromatium bheemlicum?", "synonym_description": "Marichromatium bheemlicum is also known as M. bheemlicum or JA124.

The high salt-tolerant property of the purified protease could be important for applications in various biotechnological processes which takes place at high salinity or osmotic pressures. 3.4 Effect of metals ions, surfactants and organic solvents on protease activity Effect of various metals on protease activity was presented in Table 8. The enzyme activity was enhanced with the addition of Mg2+ followed by Ca2+ and inhibited by Fe2+, Zn2+ and EDTA. Similarly, Shah et al.

All components could be chemically converted into each other. Tartrolon C (10) was also isolated from a Streptomyces species (Lewer et al., 2003). It was active on the beet army worm and tobacco bud worm, with minimum emergent larvicide concentration of 125mg/kg on both insects, approximately 40× and 310× less active than a standard of spinosyn A. Tartrolons acted against Gram-positive bacteria with similar MIC values. Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and fungi were insensitive, but mammalian cells were strongly inhibited, especially by tartrolon B. Tartrolon B inhibited the syntheses of several important cellular macromolecules in S. aureus but had no effect on isolated RNA polymerase and DNA polymerase from E. coli. Hence, tartrolon acts either specifically on enzymes of Gram-positive bacteria or, more probably, it interferes with energy delivery or membrane integrity. Experiments with feeding the production strain Sorangium cellulosum with sodium [1-13C]acetate, [13CH3]methionine, and sodium [1,2-13C2]acetate were performed to investigate the biosynthesis of the tartrolons (Schummer et al., 1996), see Fig. 3 .", "id": 380, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Sorangium cellulosum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "56+Sorangium cellulosum"}

These species are well known acidogenic bacteria that can decompose various organic matters into small size of soluble organics. The abundance of Pseudomonas caeni became viable with temperature decrease, which is known as a denitrifying bacterium found in ammonium-oxidizing bioreactor (Xiao et al., 2009). However, in overall, the change of bacterial community seems less, compared to the archaeal community. In total, 166,972 OTU (average 27,829 ± 7726) was obtained from all samples in archaeal community analysis. The archaeal sequences were assigned by selecting seven representative OTUs (≥97 % of similarity), which were belonged to Methanoculleus, Methanobrevibacter, Methanocorpusculum, Methanosarcina, and Methanolobus (Fig. 2B). These genera were often found in PS and anaerobic digester sludge, and are known to utilize H2/CO2 and/or acetate as substrates (Rea et al., 2007; Asakawa and Nagaoka, 2003; Shin et al., 2019). Unlike bacterial community, it seems that archaeal community was significantly affected by the different storage temperature. The abundance of Methanobrevibacter became dominant, while the abundance of Methanoculleus and Methanocorpusculum decreased. In terms of species level analysis, Methanoculleus bourgensis, classified as mesophilic methanogens, was found to be a dominant member in the fresh PS, accounting for 37 % of the total sequences. However, its dominance was sharply decreased to 0.3–4.0 % after storage, which was decreased with temperature decrease (Asakawa and Nagaoka, 2003).

Second, pyrosequencing was performed on the same TaqMan PCR amplicon by using a sequencing primer targeting the conserved region that subsequently reads through the flanking and variable region. Species identity was then obtained from the sequence, as each species had at least 2 unique substitutions relative to the others. 3.2 Assay performance of TaqMan PCR The assay was tested on serial 10-fold dilutions of a liquid culture of C. jejuni, and the Ct values were plotted against log10 CFU. This revealed a linearity (R 2) of 0.99, efficiency (E) of 88%, and detection limit of 12 CFU/25 μL PCR. In order to evaluate the assay specificity, the TaqMan PCR and pyrosequencing assays were applied on boiled colonies of a reference strain collection containing 9 different Campylobacter strains. Additionally, the TaqMan PCR assay was applied on 40 non-Campylobacter clinical isolates of various gastrointestinal species. Both assays proved 100% specific on all tested strains and isolates. The sensitivity of the TaqMan PCR assay was investigated by spiking 10-fold serial dilutions of a liquid C. jejuni culture into aliquots of stool samples derived from 3 different patients. Total DNA from each aliquot was subsequently extracted by NucliSENS easyMAG and analyzed by the TaqMan PCR assay. This procedure established a detection limit at approximately 55,000 C. jejuni CFU/mL feces.

However, the ability to use only two amino acids, namely alanine and glycine (weak growth), as a source of carbon and energy is a much rarer phenomenon. To our surprise strain S-94T did not even grow on casamino acids or a mixture of all natural amino acids as a source of carbon, energy and nitrogen. Moreover, casamino acids and the amino acid mixture of Hudson et al. [15] promoted the growth of the organism on citrate and succinate in the minimal medium without ammonium salts, appearing therefore, to serve as a source of nitrogen. We initially thought that casamino acids could contain ammonium salts from the spontaneous breakdown of amino acids or nitrogenous organic compounds that served as nitrogen source for growth of the organism in the presence of organic acids. However, the filter-sterilized amino acid mixture of Hudson et al. [15] also promoted the growth of the organism in the minimal medium containing succinate or citrate and presumably did not contain large amounts of breakdown products. It turned out that the casamino acids and the amino acid mixture [15] contained only very low concentrations of alanine, and even lower levels of glycine, that could not support visible growth. It is, however, difficult to explain the promotion of growth on succinate and citrate by proline, glutamate and glutamine, none of which serve as sole source of carbon, energy and nitrogen. We speculate that amino acids are taken up very slowly by transport systems, while organic acids are rapidly taken up. The low rates of amino acid uptake could provide enough ammonia for biosynthesis and growth of the organism on organic acids, but would not provide enough carbon and energy to promote growth within the time used to assess carbon source assimilation. The species of the other genera within the family “Oxalobacteriaceae” utilize carbohydrates for growth and have higher G+C mole ratios of the DNA.

The composition of the culture medium was optimized by experimental designs. The enzymatic activities obtained in the optimized culture medium (105 g L−1 LGF, 3.76 g L−1 urea and 7.52 g L−1 K2HPO4) were 59.40 ± 0.56 U mL−1 and 12.65 ± 0.09 U mL−1 for α-amylases and glucoamylases, respectively, representing an increase of 9.78 and 19.77 fold in the initial enzymatic production.

Currently, the genus includes 18 species, 17 of which are lipid-dependent. In the speciation of some of these yeasts a process of adaptation to different animal species is clearly detected. For example, Malassezia equina is mainly isolated from horses and Malassezia nana from cats. It should be noted that most species of this genus have been isolated from mammals and only a few of them have been isolated from birds. Concerning the presence of these yeasts, and compared to mammals, far fewer studies have been carried out on birds. It is not surprising, anyway, that two of the last species described, Malassezia brasiliensis and Malassezia psittaci, have been isolated from birds, specifically from pet parrots in Brazil. 2 On the other hand, the vast majority of the species in this genus can grow at 37°C, and very few do so at 40°C. Malassezia cuniculi, a species that rabbits have on their skin, grows better at 37°C and 40°C than at 32°C, the latter being the optimal temperature for the maintenance of Malassezia yeasts. This higher temperature may be explained by the fact that the normal body temperature of rabbits varies between 38.5°C and 40°C. On the contrary, low temperatures are not good for Malassezia yeasts since they lose viability, the reason why it is not recommended to maintain them at room temperature or at 4°C. An exception to this behavior has been found in the last species described in this genus that has been isolated from bats: Malassezia vespertilionis. 3 Most bat species from which this yeast was isolated can hibernate up to 7 months a year (Fig. 1 ). In this state, the animals lower their basal temperature close to the 7–9°C existing in the caves or any other habitat where they hibernate. For this reason, we are not surprised that this new species can grow slowly at 7°C.

The bacterial isolate was confirmed to be Rhodococcus jostii and the strain name was given to be PE9VJ (NCBI GenBank accession number MK114119). 3.2 Experimental design and response surface analysis of DEHP degradation at minimal level Bacterial strain, Rhodococcus jostii PEVJ9 used in the present study was optimized for its growth in MSM medium amended with DEHP based on an experimental design and response surface methodology. The interaction and quadratic effects of the variables: temperature, pH, DEHP concentration, agitation, time and product of variables on growth and esterase production by the bacterial strain were carried out. Experimental design had 245 responses including three replicate factors. The desirability 3D- plot for optimal growth was revealed to be 550 mg L−1, time to 5.5 day, temperature 40 °C, agitation 125 rpm and pH 7.2 (Jayshree and Vasudevan, 2019). In the present study, experimental design of Box-Behnken was performed at optimized condition; exceptionally at varied DEHP concentration (1–100 μg L−1) and incubation time (12–72 h). Based upon the results obtained (Table 1 ), pareto chart, main effect plot and interaction plots were plotted (S. Fig. 2). Degradation of DEHP at very minimal level of 1 μg L−1 was observed to be only 30% even after 72 h; however 100 μg L−1 was degraded to 66% at the end of incubation period. Decrease in degradation rate was observed as the availability of DEHP decreased in medium. This might be due to hydrophobicity and lesser assimilation of the compound DEHP by the bacterial strain. Box-Behnken design was used to estimate the significance of input variables i.e., DEHP concentration and incubation period which in turn affects the degradation of DEHP by Rhodococcus jostii PEVJ9. Three dimensional surface and contour plots were plotted applying response surface methodology, so as to analyse the optimal condition for the degradation of DEHP as a micro-pollutant (Fig. 2 ). Statistical significance are given in S. Table 4. The regression coefficient for the degradation was estimated against DEHP concentration and time; highly significant R2 = 99.74% was determined as an acceptable coefficient value. The regression equation obtained for DEHP degradation was, Degradation = − 1.36155 + 0.148903 ∗ DEHP concentration + 0.44053 ∗ Degradation time − 0.00147186 ∗ DEHP concentration ^ 2 + 0.00504467 ∗ DEHP concentration ∗ Degradation time + 0.0 ∗ Degradation time ^ 2 The height of solid mesh throughout the experiment at varied concentrations of DEHP and incubation periods represents the percentage of degradation. In the present study, there is a gradual rise in degradation rate from 30 to 66% in response to 1 to 100 μg L−1 DEHP, respectively. However, results reveal that DEHP as a micro-pollutant are not degraded completely; in order to enhance the degradation rate, biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles onto bacterial cell surface was carried out. 3.3 Experimental design and response surface analysis of DEHP degradation at minimal level in the presence of SAM-silver nanoparticles 3.3.1 Plackett-Burman experimental design and response surface analysis for an optimized synthesis of Silver nanoparticles Experimental design for the optimization of biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles was carried at varied variables such as silver nitrate concentration, DEHP concentration, temperature, pH and agitation. The results of 25 responses at varied experimental parameters are given in the S. Table 5. This experimental design demonstrates the resistance of silver toxicity by the bacterial strain, Rhodococcus jostii PEVJ9, optimal concentration of silver nitrate for biogenic reduction of silver nitrate to silver nanoparticles, toxic level of silver metal towards bacterial cells and degradation of DEHP at micro-pollutant level. Results of Plackett-Burman experimental design in the S. Table 5 reveals that 0.5 mM of silver nitrate concentration is not toxic to the bacterial cells since, to the maximum of 70 × 106 cells mL−1 were measured at 0.5 mM of silver nitrate; however 1.0 mM of silver nitrate exhibits toxicity and decreases bacterial growth to 40 × 106 cells mL−1. An optimized condition for the simultaneous synthesis of silver nanoparticles and growth of Rhodococcus jostii PEVJ9 upon utilization of DEHP was determined to be 0.43 mM of silver nitrate, 9.9 μg L−1 of DEHP, 40 °C temperature, 7.0 pH and 100 rpm.", "id": 937, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Rhodococcus globerulus?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "33008+Rhodococcus globerulus"}

A very peculiar kind of lymphadenitis, affecting both superficial and deep lymph nodes, develops in immunocompromised patients, particularly during immune system restoration that follows treatment with HAART. The disease, known as inmmunoreconstitution syndrome [21], is a paradoxical reaction of the lymphatic system to a pre-existing, undiagnosed mycobacterial infection. Cutis and Soft Tissues Infections NTM infections of cutis and soft tissues (hand, elbow, knee and foot being the main sites) are characterized by granulomatous lesions developing a few weeks after infection. Satellite lymph nodes also may be affected and evolution to ulceration and cellulitis, and even to cutaneous dissemination, is not rare. The most common sources include contact with contaminated water or infected fish, traumas and surgical wounds. The cutaneous infection caused by Mycobacterium marinum, which mostly affects those who own aquariums and other people in contact with fish, is the best known. The lesion, usually at the hand or the forearm, is initially nodular but may subsequently ulcerate; the sporotrychoid form is characterized by small nodules along lymphatic ducts [22]. Spontaneous healing of the lesion is very rare. Mycobacterium marinum is a photochromogenic species with optimal growth at 32°C; when incubated at this temperature, mature colonies develop in <2 weeks, whereas the standard incubation at 37°C may be responsible for growth failure.", "id": 471, "question": "what is the optimal growth temperature of Mycobacterium bohemicum?", "synonym_description": "", "title": "56425+Mycobacterium bohemicum"}

To investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in the Sine-Saloum region, rodents and insectivores were captured alive in February 2013; 30 isolates of Bartonella spp. were recovered from their blood. None of the isolates belonged to already described Bartonella species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they belonged to three separate genetic clusters within the genus Bartonella. Comparison between gltA genes of recovered isolates and those of officially recognized species allowed the conclusion that the three clusters may represent three distinct new species of Bartonella [4]. In this paper we describe one of these Bartonella species, Bartonella saheliensis strain 077, isolated from the blood of Gerbilliscus gambianus in Senegal [4]. The bacterial strain was cultured and isolated. A taxonogenomics approach, including matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), coupled with phylogenetic analysis was used, as well as main phenotypic description and genome sequencing, in order to fully describe it [15,16]. Here, we present a summary classification and a set of features for B. saheliensis sp. nov. strain 077 together with the description of the complete genomic sequence and annotation. All these characteristics support the definition of the species B. saheliensis. Samples and bacterial culture In February 2013, as part of a 6-day prospective study on tick-borne relapsing fever in West Africa, 119 small mammals were captured alive in two sites (Dielmo and Ndiop) using wire mesh traps baited with peanut butter or onions; they included 116 rodents and three shrews (Crocidura cf. olivieri). The rodents were morphologically identified: five Arvicantis niloticus, 56 Gerbilliscus gambianus, 49 Mastomys erythroleucus, 5 Mus musculus, and 1 Praomys daltoni. They were anaesthetized and opened under sterile conditions. The isolation of the Bartonella strains was performed as described previously [6].
